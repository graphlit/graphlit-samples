# Graphlit Sample Applications

If you're building AI chatbots, agents or other vertical AI apps, [Graphlit](https://www.graphlit.com) simplifies and accelerates your development.

Compared to existing Open Source solutions like LangChain or LlamaIndex, which require the DIY combination of vector databases, LLM embeddings, cloud storage and data pipelines, our managed Graphlit platform handles your AI and data infrastructure for you.

No need to be limited by the OpenAI Assistants API - no file size limits (on all tiers), or storage limitations (on the Growth tier).

ðŸ’¸ Graphlit is **free** to use, up to 1GB of content, and [paid plans](https://www.graphlit.com/#pricing) start at $49/mo + credit usage.

ðŸ’¡ [Signup today](https://portal.graphlit.dev/), and you can be ingesting data and having LLM conversations within minutes.

With integrated web scraping, Graphlit ingests existing websites by sitemap. With built-in audio transcription, it indexes podcasts, videos and meeting recordings. Any format of unstructured data will be made searchable, via metadata filtering and text and image embeddings. Slack, Notion, Google Mail and Microsoft Outlook email are supported as data feeds. Create automated LLM-generated alerts on people, places, companies or topics found in your content.

We offer a wide variety of [Google Colab Notebooks](/python/Notebook%20Examples/), showing the capabilities of the Graphlit Platform.

We also provide [Streamlit Applications](/python/Streamlit%20Applications/), which demonstrate file upload and ingestion, web crawling and other UI-driven operations.

## Node.js
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphlit-client.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/graphlit-client) 

We have created several Next.js starter applications which be deployed to Vercel.

For example, you can deploy our [Chat](/nextjs/chat/) application to upload and chat with PDFs, audio transcripts and more.

Or you can extract Markdown from [files](/nextjs/file-extraction/) or [web sites](/nextjs/web-extraction/)

## .NET
[![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Graphlit.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/Graphlit)

We also have created a [.NET CLI](/dotnet/GraphlitIngest/) for ingesting content into the Graphlit Platform.
