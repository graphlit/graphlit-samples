Based on this [great project](https://github.com/bhancockio/crewai-rag-deep-dive/blob/main/README.md) written by Brandon Hancock, we emulate Brandon's workflow and show how to use Graphlit with CrewAI. In this example, we show the new IngestTool, which can be used to ingest files by URL into Graphlit, and the RetrievalTool, which can be used to search within a piece or content, or across your entire knowledge base."
