Based on this [great project](https://github.com/bhancockio/crewai-rag-deep-dive/blob/main/README.md) written by Brandon Hancock, we emulate Brandon's workflow and show how to use Graphlit with CrewAI. In this example, we show the new IngestTool, which can be used to ingest files by URL into Graphlit, and the RetrievalTool, which can be used to search within a piece or content, or across your entire knowledge base."

Washing machine drain line for example cannot be checked for leaks or the ability to handle the volume during drain cycle. Older homes with galvanized supply lines or cast iron drain lines can be obstructed and barely working during an inspection but then fails under heavy use. If the water is turned off or not used for periods of time (like a vacant home waiting for closing) rust or deposits within the pipes can further clog the piping system. Please be aware that the inspector has your best interest in mind. Any repair items mentioned in this report should be considered before purchase. It is recommended that qualified contractors be used in your further inspection or repair issues as it relates to the comments in this inspection report.\n",

Washing machine drain line for example cannot be checked for leaks or the ability to handle the volume during drain cycle. Older homes with galvanized supply lines or cast iron drain lines can be obstructed and barely working during an inspection but then fails under heavy use. If the water is turned off or not used for periods of time (like a vacant home waiting for closing) rust or deposits within the pipes can further clog the piping system.
