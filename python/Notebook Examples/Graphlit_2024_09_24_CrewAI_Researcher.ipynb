Below the CPU ranking charts and tables, this guide also gives you a basic introduction to CPU benchmarks and includes a list of commonly-used CPU benchmarks. We have benchmarked CPUs for over 25 years, so we've preserved many of our legacy historical CPU rankings on the second page of this article.\n",
            "\n",
            "Your CPU is considered a computer's most important component. CPU benchmark comparisons help us sort out the differences between chips, but you'll find a dizzying collection of model numbers and specs from both Intel and AMD. We've listed the best cheap CPUs and best CPUs for workstations and even covered the Intel vs AMD feature debate in other articles, but if you want to know the CPU rankings and how you can run CPU benchmarks of your own, this CPU benchmarks hierarchy is for you.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intel's 14th-Gen Raptor Lake processors have arrived, with the highest-end overclockable models landing first. The 6 GHz $589 Core i9-14900K , $409 Core i7-14700K , and $319 Core i5-14600K , facing off with AMD’s Zen 4 Ryzen 7000 lineup. We've added those models to our rankings below.\n",
            "\n",
            "The AMD Ryzen 5 5600X3D is a truly exceptional chip . Only Micro Center has this chip, and it is selling in its stores only, marking the only truly exclusive CPU launch we've seen in recent memory. The 5600X3D is the CPU to get for AM4 upgraders, or if you're shopping for a powerful budget gaming rig. However, as with all of AMD's gaming-specialized X3D parts, the chip comes with lower performance in productivity apps, which is exacerbated by its older Zen 3 architecture. That said, it's the best gaming-per-dollar CPU we've ever benchmarked, so check the review for the particulars.\n",
            "\n",
            "The $449 Ryzen 7 7800X3D is now the fastest gaming chip money can buy. This eight-core 16-thread chip uses AMD's 3D V-Cache technology to accelerate gaming performance, but the tech doesn't accelerate all games and results in reduced performance in some applications. However, for gaming, AMD's 3D V-Cache tech is the uncontested leader. For ultra-high-end gaming-focused rigs, the $699 Ryzen 9 7950X3D is the uncontested leader with 16 cores and 32 threads that are just as adept at cutting through the heaviest productivity workloads as they are at blasting through the latest game titles. We also recently reviewed the Ryzen 9 7900X3D which has the same tech, but its pricing is too high.\n",
            "\n",
            "That chip faces off with the Intel Core i9-13900KS , which is among the fastest desktop PC chips ever made, but it has a $699 price tag and a voracious appetite for power that requires expensive supporting componentry to deliver a single-digit percentage CPU benchmark improvement over the standard Core i9-13900K . Overall, the 13900KS' small performance gains don't make sense for the average user.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the lower end of the spectrum, we also have the $110 Core i3-13100F , which is also available with graphics as the $150 Core i3-13100 . The Core i3-13100F provides solid performance in gaming for its price point, but the Ryzen 5 5600 is also a stout contender.\n",
            "\n",
            "### We'll explain how we ranked the processors under each table. The game testing ranking is first. We also include a productivity application performance metric, which we've split up into single- and multi-threaded measurements. We also have an integrated graphics CPU gaming benchmark ranking so you can see how AMD's APUs stack up to Intel's processors.\n",

Simply run a CPU benchmark before you make any changes, then re-test after changes to see the results. You can head to our deep-dive details of overclocking in our How to Overclock a CPU guide for more details on tuning your processor, but if you want to learn how to benchmark your CPU, you're in the right place.\n",
            "\n",
            "How do you benchmark your CPU? Well, that's not as complicated as you might think. Choosing the best CPU benchmarks can be a daunting task, but the general rule is that the best performance benchmark is simply measuring the performance of the programs you use the most. However, you might not be able to find other benchmarks to compare to, so these real-world benchmarks might not help you compare your performance to other CPUs.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, if the programs you frequently use don't have built-in benchmarks you can also use similar types of programs (renderers or encoders, for instance) as a proxy for your workload. There are also several well-known benchmarks with large databases that enable easy comparisons. You can also compare your results to the benchmarks you see in our library of reviews to get a good sense of how your system stacks up. We have a list of some great productivity benchmarks, and their download links, below.\n",
            "\n",
            "These same theories apply to CPU game benchmarking — the best CPU benchmark is the game that you play the most. You can download an fps counter, like FRAPS , to measure performance during your gaming session. Games can vary widely, so we don't have a specific list of titles to test. However, you can use the gaming CPU benchmarks you see in our reviews as a good starting point.\n",
            "\n",
            "You can also use synthetic gaming CPU benchmarks, a few of which we have listed below. Just be aware that these synthetic CPU benchmarks don't tend to translate well to real-world gaming, but they do show us the raw amount of compute power exposed to game engines. However, given their stability and repeatability, these are great benchmarks for comparing performance before and after any changes you may make to your system.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most often overlook web-browser performance, but these are among the best CPU benchmarks to measure performance in single-threaded workloads, which helps quantify the snappiness in your system.

            "\n",
            "### Best CPU Benchmarks You Can Run Cinebench R23 ( MS Store ) — This rendering CPU benchmark program has both single- and multi-core benchmark modes. This is one of the most commonly-used CPU benchmarks. UL Benchmarks 3DMark — This synthetic CPU benchmark has a plethora of built-in tests for both CPUs and GPUs  (see our best GPUs ) and is updated regularly with new tests. This is the go-to synthetic gaming test for many. CPU-Z — This is a common utility that exposes the details of your processor, but it also has a built-in CPU benchmark that is incredibly simple to run. The single- and multi-thread test results don't correlate well to real-world tasks, but the tests' stability makes them well suited for before and after comparisons. CPU-Z test results are also widely shared among enthusiasts, so it's easy to find comparison systems. POV-Ray — This rendering CPU benchmark has both single- and multi-threaded test options but uses a heavier distribution of AVX instructions than Cinebench to create a taxing CPU benchmark. C-Ray — This CPU benchmark uses a raytracer rendering engine to measure a CPU's multi-threaded performance in floating-point operations. HandBrake — The HandBrake encoder comes with a plethora of options, so you can easily tailor the encoding CPU benchmark to your needs. Simply measure the amount of time it takes to encode a video, and then use that as your baseline for comparison. Corona — This is another popular rendering utility and is a simple-one click CPU benchmark that uses the Chaos Corona render engine to measure CPU performance in multi-threaded workloads. WebXPRT 4 — This is a click-to-run CPU benchmark that runs in your browser to measure performance in HTML5, JavaScript, and WebAssembly-based tests. This is a great CPU benchmark to measure single-threaded performance. ARES-6 — This is a click-to-run CPU benchmark that runs in your browser to measure performance in JavaScript but has a heavy weighting towards the neural network (machine learning) workloads that are becoming increasingly common. This is a great CPU benchmark to measure single-threaded performance. y-cruncher — This CPU benchmark runs from a command line, so it isn't the most user-friendly. However, it calculates Pi using the latest AVX instruction sets in a heavily-threaded manner, making it among the best to measure SIMD performance. Beware, this test can break overclocks easily (which also means it is great for stress testing).\n",

The innovative 3D-stacked V-Cache design boosts gaming performance to new heights but results in reduced performance in some productivity apps.

In contrast, AMD's Ryzen 5 7600X and Ryzen 5 7600 are better all-rounders and sell for much less than before.

For gaming, clock speed is generally more important than the number of cores: Higher CPU clock speeds generally translate to snappier performance in simple tasks like gaming, while more cores will help you get through heavy workloads faster. Budget for a full system: Don't pair a strong CPU with weak storage, RAM , and graphics .

After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship over at Expert Reviews. Besides that, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel and Podcast for the last 7 years. It’s been a long road, but all that experience somehow landed me a dream job covering gaming hardware. I’m a self-confessing PlayStation fanboy, but my experience covering the larger business and developer side of the whole industry has given me a strong knowledge of all platforms. When I’m not testing out every peripheral I can get my hands on, I’m probably either playing tennis or dissecting game design for an upcoming video essay.

            "The contenders in this segment include the likes of the Ryzen 5 4500, Core i3-10100F or 10105F, all of which can be had for about $80 right now, then there's the Ryzen 5 5500 and Core 13-12100F at $100. The next step takes you to around $120 for the Core i5-10400F and Ryzen 5 3600, while the Ryzen 5 5600 can be had for $130 .\n",

            "For those of you building a new PC from the ground up, we recommend avoiding the Ryzen 5 4500 and Core i3-10100F/10105F. They're now only $20 less than the Core i3-12100F, which offers substantially better performance and can be upgraded to 13th-gen Raptop Lake parts down the track.\n",

There are also a number of well priced Intel B660 boards that can support Core i9 processors without any throttling issues, such as the $130 MSI Pro B660M-A, but if you never want to upgrade beyond a Core i5, the Asrock B660M Pro RS works for $90 – the $40 extra for the MSI model does buy you a more capable product in terms of power delivery though.\n",

Alternatively, if you want to invest in DDR5, we'd skip B660 boards and instead go for the Asrock Z690M PG Riptide, a great value board at $160. Then for memory, Crucial 8GB modules work well enough and $85 for a 16GB kit is very cheap. If you're a bit more serious about your RAM, G.Skill's Ripjaws S5 DDR5-5200 32GB memory can be had for $145, taking the DDR5 combo to $405.\n",

Then $60 gets you a decent 16GB DDR4-3600 CL16 memory kit or $110 for 32GB, meaning you can piece the AM4 combo together for as little as $280 – $20 less than the 12100F, and you have the luxury of being able to upgrade to the 5800X3D down the track, or for productivity performance the 5900X or 5950X.\n",

The i5-12600K at $280 is a reasonable deal, but as we found in a recent value analysis it's worse value than the 13600K for gaming, and much worse when it comes to productivity, so the 12th-gen Core i5 is also a write off.\n",

            "Before continuing, if you are relatively new to PC building and aren't familiar with the specifics of what makes up a processor, we'd recommend you first read our general-purpose Best CPUs for 2024 article. We will proceed from here under the assumption that you understand the basics of processors. (Credit: Molly Flores)\n",
            "\n",
            "When it comes to gaming, you'll see lots of debate online about what is most important in a processor to help you get the best performance. Some argue that clock speed is everything, and the highest-clocked CPU will invariably perform best. (Occasionally, that is correct.) Others argue that having more cores will net you a greater advantage. (Sometimes that helps, too.) You also find a fair bit of consideration around the cache being all-important. (Again: Sometimes yes, sometimes no.)\n",
            "\n",
            "### Like with many things in life, none of these more extreme viewpoints is wholly accurate. Having a balanced mix of cores, clock speed, and cache will get you the best results in the widest sense. Beyond that, the results you get can vary quite a bit from game to game, or from game genre to game genre. There's no magic-bullet solution that will work for all users, all budgets, and all games. Let's get into why below.\n",
            "\n",
            "Clock Speed Is Not Everything for Games\n",
            "\n",
            "As everyone knows, higher clock speeds enable a processor to perform better...if everything else is equal. But everything seldom is, and so \"clock speed\" as a single number or overarching concept is far too simplistic to make decisions on alone, especially due to the influence of different microarchitectures. To help with understanding this concept, imagine a processor as an engine in a car. The clock speed, in this case, would be not the speed the car is traveling at, but the speed of the engine, or how many revolutions per minute (RPMs) that the car is running at. Just like how different engines deliver different amounts of horsepower at the same RPM, different processors will give you different amounts of performance at the same clock speed unless they share the same architecture (and all else is equal, too).\n",
            "\n",
            "### Clock speed, just like the RPMs, goes up and down as more work is called upon by the CPU or engine. Performance and power consumption rise and fall in concert with clock speed, which is a universal truth, but we should never rely solely on clock speed to make a decision on processors. Though we can say the exact same thing about core count.\n",
            "\n",
            "Core Count: More Cores Aren't Always Better\n",
            "\n",
            "Just as we cannot rely entirely on clock speed to make a decision, we also cannot rely simply on core count. The architecture that the processor cores is built on has a huge impact on performance here, too, but we also sometimes see processors with more cores running at slower clock speeds than processors with fewer cores. This is often a necessity for running large amounts of cores, as you'll have only so much power to go around. Also, more cores typically generate more heat, forcing the processor to have lower clock speeds to stay within power and thermal limits (again, all else being equal). (Credit: Molly Flores)\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "We have also seen many debates over the years about just how many processor cores you need for PC gaming. It's often been argued that games, especially older ones, aren't capable of using more than just a few cores and that having additional cores delivers no benefit. These arguments are flawed, however, as they fail to take into consideration two key factors. First, they fail to consider that even if some games are able to use only a few cores, other games, especially newer ones, tend to make use of far more cores.\n",
            "\n",
            "### The second major factor is that a PC is never doing just one thing. Having more cores beyond what a game can use still can improve performance by offloading background tasks to the extra cores. The benefits from this only increase if you like to watch videos on a second monitor while gaming, if you stream your games while playing, or if you record game footage for later use. These factors make the argument against extra cores, at the very least, shortsighted.\n",
            "\n",
            "It Takes Both!\n",
            "\n",
            "We could continue to discuss the merits of different processor attributes for gaming at length, as well as the ongoing debates around them, but instead, let's get down to the key points. It's best not to lean too much to any one side of this performance equation between clock speed and cores. Don't overly focus on having the most cores or the very highest clock speed, but instead, look for a chip that is strong in both regards.\n",
            "\n",
            "Testing data suggests that the current benefits of having more cores diminish as you add ever more cores. Most graphics cards are able to operate at close to their full potential with a CPU at the level of an Intel Core i5 or an AMD Ryzen 5; beyond that, most graphics cards only gain a modest benefit from having faster CPUs, if they benefit at all. The very highest-end graphics cards (like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 ) unequivocally do benefit from faster processors, though, especially at lower resolutions, and it's likely that newer games will benefit from faster processors down the road, as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "## Taken together, we get a clear picture that likely the absolute best gaming processor we can buy for today and tomorrow will be the one with most cores and the highest clock speed. This is a good generalization to proceed with, but most folks' budgets are limited, and there is a point of diminishing returns. To determine which CPU will be the best for your specific gaming PC, we need to dive into your specific system goals.\n",
            "\n",
            "First, a Word About Cache\n",
            "\n",
            "Ordinarily, we wouldn't delve into processor cache in an overview article like this, as it's a topic a bit deep in the weeds. However, it's also been known for decades now that game performance tends to increase with the size of a processor's cache. Also, we mean cache in general, be it L1, L2, L3, or some other form of last-level cache (LLC). The amount of cache used by AMD and Intel has typically been fairly consistent inside of each product line, though. Due to a lack of deviation inside of product lines, in the past, we could have simply skipped the discussion of cache or worked it into a discussion on microarchitectures. But AMD and its recent 3D V-Cache-equipped processors require us to approach the subject with a bit more depth. (Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n",
            "\n",
            "Though large pools of cache can be beneficial to gaming, cache requires a lot of transistors and a relatively large amount of space on a processor die at today's extremes. This makes it relatively expensive to implement, and the addition of excess cache can drive up costs quickly. Cache is also relatively power-hungry and generates a considerable amount of heat. The use of too much cache, therefore, can adversely affect battery performance (in laptops) or power consumption (in desktops), and the added heat can force the rest of the chip to be clocked lower so as to keep the CPU cores from overheating.\n",
            "\n",
            "With these drawbacks, you might start to wonder if not having cache would be beneficial, but cache is absolutely essential. Without cache, modern processors would be far slower, and adding extra cache, at times, has brought about major performance gains in the past. How much cache a processor needs again comes down to a balancing act, which is why AMD and Intel typically don't vary the amount of cache per core on processors of the same generation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The notable modern exceptions to this are AMD's processors with 3D V-Cache, such as the AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D , the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D , and the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D . Each of these processors has an extra element inside of them that's entirely cache with a total of 64MB. On each of these processors, this is counted as part of the L3 cache, but it's really an LLC that's physically separate with slightly different performance characteristics from the L3. (Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n",
            "\n",
            "The cache chip gets stacked on top of the chip that contains the CPU cores in each processor, which mandates some compromises from a chip-design POV. These chips have reduced clock speeds to deal with the extra heat produced by the cache chip. As a result, their peak raw CPU performance is typically lower in most applications than their near-identical counterparts that lack the 3D V-Cache. These processors do have a slight edge in games, but this advantage is mostly seen in games running at 1080p or similarly \"low\" resolutions. The advantage disappears in many games at higher resolutions, where the limits of frame rates are bound to the graphics card.\n",

Gaming at 4K can actually be \"easier,\" in a sense, than gaming at 1080p, as the graphics card is more likely to reach the limit of its frame-pushing power before the CPU is the component holding it back.\n",

Enjoying 4K-resolution gaming is still a bit of a rarified level for most shoppers; plus, high-refresh-rate monitors (above 60Hz) with 4K native resolution aren't casual purchases. If you happen to buy a monitor that's able to output a 4K signal above 60fps, and you are also buying a top-tier graphics card, such as an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX or an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 , you may want to consider stepping up the processor to an AMD Ryzen 9 or an Intel Core i9 just to be safe and to avoid any potential bottlenecks.\n",

Except in extreme-mismatch scenarios, or unless you game at 1080p with exceedingly high refresh rates, you are more likely to have your graphics card hit its performance limit before your CPU does. This doesn't hold up, say, if you paired an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 with an Intel Core i3.

Buying a faster processor can be beneficial in many scenarios outside of gaming; it will enhance your PC's multitasking ability; and getting a faster processor now could keep the door open to a GPU upgrade in a couple of years without having to build a whole new PC. We know of many gamers who do just this and opt for a reasonably fast CPU beyond what they strictly need in the moment. Then, they then use this processor and motherboard throughout the life of two GPUs before doing another full system upgrade or rebuild.\n",

Intel does slightly edge out AMD in price versus performance thanks to their recent release of 13th and 14th gen Raptor Lake chips, but they are still pretty neck and neck with Ryzen’s 7000 processors. Both offer the latest connectivity like PCIe 5.0, DDR5 memory, and newer sockets, along with plenty of cores to cruise through the best PC games .\n",
            "\n",
            "### Speaking of cores, as a general rule of thumb, the more, the merrier. CPU cores essentially receive instructions and in turn, perform specific actions. Therefore as you increase the core count, the more the processor can do for you.\n",

            "Cores\n",

However, you may want a higher core count for more processor-intense titles – like RTS games and management sims. A faster, more robust CPU can power more AI elements and help raise frame rates.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Intel also introduced two different types of cores with its 12th gen processors, P-cores and E-cores. P-cores do most of the heavy lifting, hitting higher speeds and taking on beefier workloads like games – essentially the cores you’re used to seeing in CPUs. E-cores are much less powerful, generally working on background tasks to help ease the load of the P-cores. AMD  has yet to differentiate its cores.\n",

            "\n",
            "### Though core count is important, speed may be just as, if not more. You generally get a base clock and boost clock, telling you how fast the CPU runs, with a higher number of gigahertz (GHz), meaning a snappier performance in your games. Many options we’ve chosen are also unlocked for overclocking – letting you push the CPU past its listed clock speed limits – though there’s always a risk of damaging the chip when you do this.\n",

But its hybrid design, which offered one eight-core chiplet (or CCD) with the extra 64MB of L3 cache fused on top of it and another CCD without, demanded some extra hoops for the operating system to jump through and also sacrificed some of a standard 16-core chip's raw multithreaded performance.\n",

            "So why didn't AMD simply make this a 65W chip to begin with? Well, when it runs into Intel's mid-range competition, the blue team chips do often pull slightly ahead.

A tweaked front end, a doubling of L2 cache, AVX-512 support and improved branch prediction helped to deliver an IPC gain of around 13%.

Based on the RDNA 3 architecture, there are 12 Compute Units, giving it 768 shader cores in total, clocked at up to 2.9 GHz.
