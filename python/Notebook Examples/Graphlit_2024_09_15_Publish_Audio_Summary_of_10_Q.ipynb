24.\n\n[00:00:12] Today, we'll break down the key financial metrics,\n\n[00:00:16] strategic moves, and future outlook for the tech giant,\n\n[00:00:19] providing you with a comprehensive understanding of their current standing and what lies ahead.\n\n[00:00:26] First, let's dive into the revenue and earnings performance.\n\n[00:00:30] Microsoft reported total revenue of $56,500,000,000\n\n[00:00:35] for the quarter ending\n\n[00:00:37] September 30th 23,\n\n[00:00:39] marking a 13% increase from the same period last year.\n\n[00:00:44] Net income saw an even more impressive rise,\n\n[00:00:47] up 27%\n\n[00:00:48] to 22,300,000,000.\n\n[00:00:51] This growth was driven primarily by a significant increase in service\n\n[00:00:55] and other revenue, which jumped to 41,000,000,000\n\n[00:00:58] from $34,400,000,000,\n\n[00:01:01] while product revenue saw a slight decline to 155,000,000,000.\n\n[00:01:06] The company's gross margin also improved,\n\n[00:01:09] reaching 40,200,000,000\n\n[00:01:11] compared to $34,700,000,000\n\n[00:01:14] last year,\n\n[00:01:15] reflecting strong profitability.\n\n[00:01:18] Next, we examine the segment and geographic performance.\n\n[00:01:22] Microsoft's productivity and business processes segment\n\n[00:01:26] saw a 13% revenue increase to $18,600,000,000\n\n[00:01:30] with operating income up 20%\n\n[00:01:33] to 10,000,000,000.\n\n[00:01:35] The intelligent cloud segment performed exceptionally well\n\n[00:01:39] with revenue up 19%\n\n[00:01:41] to 24,300,000,000\n\n[00:01:44] and operating income soaring 31% to 11 toned 8,000,000,000 does.\n\n[00:01:49] The more personal computing segment\n\n[00:01:51] also showed growth with revenue increasing by 3% to 13,700,000,000\n\n[00:01:58] and operating income up 23%\n\n[00:02:00] to 5,200,000,000.\n\n[00:02:03] Geographically,\n\n[00:02:04] revenue in the United States rose to 28.8000000000\n\n[00:02:08] dollars,\n\n[00:02:09] while other countries contributed\n\n[00:02:12] 27,700,000,000,\n\n[00:02:13] both showing healthy growth.\n\n[00:02:16] Moving on to cash flow analysis,\n\n[00:02:18] Microsoft's operating activities generated\n\n[00:02:22] 30,600,000,000,\n\n[00:02:24] a substantial increase from $23,200,000,000\n\n[00:02:27] in the previous year.\n\n[00:02:29] Financing activities\n\n[00:02:31] also saw a significant rise to $14,800,000,000\n\n[00:02:35] compared to a negative 10,900,000,000\n\n[00:02:37] last year, indicating strong financial flexibility.\n\n[00:02:42] Investing activities improved to 503,000,000\n\n[00:02:45] from a negative 3 point guar\n\n[00:02:47] point 1,000,000,000\n\n[00:02:49] showcasing\n\n[00:02:50] prudent capital management.\n\n[00:02:52] The company's liquidity\n\n[00:02:54] remains robust\n\n[00:02:55] with short term debt at 25,800,000,000\n\n[00:02:59] and long term debt slightly reduced to 41,900,000,000.\n\n[00:03:05] In terms of capital expenditures\n\n[00:03:07] and r and d investments,\n\n[00:03:09] Microsoft continues to prioritize innovation and growth.\n\n[00:03:13] Research and development expenses saw a slight increase to $6,700,000,000\n\n[00:03:19] while sales and marketing expenses\n\n[00:03:21] rose to $5,200,000,000.\n\n[00:03:24] General and administrative\n\n[00:03:26] costs also edged up to 1,500,000,000.\n\n[00:03:31] These investments are crucial for maintaining competitive advantage\n\n[00:03:35] and driving future growth,\n\n[00:03:37] particularly in high potential areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\n\n[00:03:43] Now\n\n[00:03:44] let's discuss some notable items and risk factors.\n\n[00:03:48] The company reported an increase in other income\n\n[00:03:51] net to $389,000,000\n\n[00:03:54] at shows,\n\n[00:03:55] and a higher provision for income taxes\n\n[00:03:58] at $5,000,000,000.\n\n[00:04:01] The effective tax rate decreased slightly to 18%.\n\n[00:04:05] Additionally,\n\n[00:04:06] Microsoft completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for 61,800,000,000\n\n[00:04:10] on October 13th 23,\n\n[00:04:12] a strategic move that could significantly\n\n[00:04:15] enhance its gaming and entertainment portfolio.\n\n[00:04:19] However, investors should be mindful of potential regulatory challenges\n\n[00:04:23] and integration risks associated with such a large acquisition.\n\n[00:04:28] Finally, we turn to management's commentary and strategic direction.\n\n[00:04:33] Microsoft's leadership remains optimistic about the future,\n\n[00:04:37] emphasizing continued investment in cloud services,\n\n[00:04:40] AI, and gaming.\n\n[00:04:42] The company's strategic initiatives are clearly reflected in the strong financial results,\n\n[00:04:47] particularly in the intelligent cloud segment.\n\n[00:04:51] However, it's essential to balance this optimism with a critical assessment of potential risks,\n\n[00:04:57] including market competition,\n\n[00:04:59] regulatory changes,\n\n[00:05:00] and economic uncertainties.\n\n[00:05:04] In conclusion,\n\n[00:05:05] Microsoft's latest 10 q filing paints a picture of a company in re\n\n[00:05:10] in robust health\n\n[00:05:11] with strong revenue growth, improved profitability,\n\n[00:05:15] and strategic invest\n\n[00:05:17] investments\n\n[00:05:18] that position it well for future success.\n\n[00:05:22] Investors and stakeholders\n\n[00:05:24] should take note of the company's solid financial foundation,\n\n[00:05:27] strategic acquisitions,\n\n[00:05:29] and ongoing commitment to innovation.\n\n[00:05:32] As always, it's crucial to stay informed and consider both opportunities\n\n[00:05:36] and risks when making investment decisions.\n\n[00:05:40] Thank you for joining us in this detailed analysis,\n\n[00:05:43] and we look forward to keeping you updated on Microsoft's journey in the court to execute in the quarters ahead.\n\n"
