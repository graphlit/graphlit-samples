Her family history is notable for premature coronary artery disease, as her father succumbed to a heart attack at the age of 54. Ms. Rogers maintains a relatively healthy lifestyle, abstaining from smoking and illicit drug use, and consumes alcohol moderately.\n\n## Clinical Presentation\n\nMs. Rogers presented to the Emergency Department with a one-week history of intermittent chest pain. The initial episode occurred while gardening, lasting between five to ten minutes, and was accompanied by shortness of breath. She has since experienced additional episodes, including one while walking her dog and another that awakened her from sleep, lasting approximately thirty minutes. The pain is described as dull and aching, originating substernally and radiating to the neck, typically triggered by exertion and relieved by rest. Notably, she denies associated symptoms such as sweating, nausea, or palpitations.\n\nUpon physical examination, Ms. Rogers exhibited elevated blood pressure (168/98 mmHg) and a systolic decrescendo murmur heard best at the second right intercostal space, radiating to the neck. Additionally, crackles were noted at the lung bases, and a third heart sound was present at the apex, suggesting possible left ventricular dysfunction.\n\n## Assessment and Differential Diagnosis\n\nThe primary assessment indicates angina pectoris likely due to ischemic heart disease, given the patient's presentation and risk factors such as hypertension and a family history of coronary artery disease. The increasing frequency of chest pain episodes, including pain at rest, raises concern for unstable angina. The presence of a systolic murmur warrants evaluation for potential valvular heart disease, though the lack of a significant carotid upstroke suggests it may be benign.\n\nDifferential diagnoses include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is less likely due to the exertional nature of the pain and absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Pulmonary conditions such as infections are also considered but are deemed unlikely given the absence of fever and cough. Musculoskeletal pain is another consideration; however, the radiating nature of the chest pain and associated dyspnea support a cardiac origin.\n\n## Management and Treatment Plan\n\nMs. Rogers has been admitted to the telemetry unit for continuous cardiac monitoring. Initial management includes the administration of aspirin to inhibit platelet aggregation and nitrates to alleviate chest pain and reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Given her hypertensive state, nitrates also aid in lowering blood pressure. Additionally, cholesterol levels will be assessed, and lifestyle modifications such as a low-fat diet and regular exercise will be recommended to mitigate further cardiovascular risk.\n\nA cardiac catheterization has been scheduled to evaluate the extent of coronary artery disease. This invasive procedure will provide detailed insights into the coronary anatomy and guide potential interventional treatments. Considering her pulmonary findings, diuretics may be initiated to manage possible left ventricular dysfunction and prevent the progression to congestive heart failure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis case underscores the importance of a thorough clinical evaluation in patients presenting with chest pain. Recognizing the signs of unstable angina and initiating prompt management can significantly impact patient outcomes. Ongoing monitoring and tailored therapeutic interventions are essential in managing ischemic heart disease and preventing adverse cardiac events."
