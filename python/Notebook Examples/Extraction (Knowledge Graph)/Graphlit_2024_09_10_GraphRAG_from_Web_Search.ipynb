Competing in the National Football League (NFL) as part of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division, the Packers are the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, established in 1919. They are the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States. Since 1957, home games have been played at Lambeau Field. They hold the record for the most wins in NFL history.\\n\\nThe Packers are the last of the \\\"small-town teams\\\" that were common in the NFL during the league\\u0027s early days of the 1920s and 1930s. Founded in 1919 by Earl \\\"Curly\\\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today\\u0027s NFL, in 1921. In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full-time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team. Although Green Bay is the smallest major league professional sports market in North America, \\u0027\\u0027Forbes\\u0027\\u0027 ranked the Packers as the world\\u0027s 27th-most-valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63\\u00a0billion.\\n\\nThe Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers, under coach Vince Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967; they were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) before the AFL\\u2013NFL merger. After Lombardi retired, the Super Bowl trophy was named for him, but the team struggled through the 1970s and 1980s. Since 1993, the team has enjoyed much regular-season success, making the playoffs 23 times and winning two Super Bowls in 1996 under head coach Mike Holmgren and 2010 under head coach Mike McCarthy. The Packers have the most wins (826) and the second-highest win\\u2013loss record (.571) in NFL history, including both regular season and playoff games.\\nThe Packers are longstanding adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who today form the NFL\\u0027s NFC North division (formerly known as the NFC Central Division). They have played more than 100 games against each of those teams, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the Kansas City Chiefs, Dallas Cowboys, and Miami Dolphins.

For nine months, from September 1777 to June 1778, the city fell under British occupation during the war\\u0027s Philadelphia campaign. In 1787, the U.S. Constitution was ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention. Philadelphia remained the nation\\u0027s largest city until 1790, and it served as the nation\\u0027s first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions until 1800, when construction of the new national capital in Washington, D.C. was completed. \\n\\nPhiladelphia maintains extensive contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.

With a population of 510,823 living within the city limits, Atlanta is the eighth most populous city in the Southeast and 37th most populous city in the United States according to the 2020 U.S. census. Situated among the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains at an elevation of just over  above sea level, Atlanta features unique topography that includes rolling hills, lush greenery, and the densest urban tree coverage of any major city in the United States.\\n\\nAtlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad, but it soon became the convergence point among several railroads, spurring its rapid growth. The largest was the Western and Atlantic Railroad, from which the name \\\"Atlanta\\\" is derived, signifying the city\\u0027s growing reputation as a major hub of transportation. During the 1950s and 1960s, it became a major organizing center of the American Civil Rights Movement, with Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, and many other locals becoming prominent figures in the movement\\u0027s leadership. In the modern era, Atlanta has remained a major center of transportation, with Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport becoming the world\\u0027s busiest airport by passenger traffic in 1998 (a position it has held every year since, except for 2020), with an estimated 93.7 million passengers in 2022.\\n\\nWith a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $473\\u00a0billion in 2021, Atlanta has the eleventh largest economy of cities in the U.S. and the 22nd largest in the world.

Atlanta established itself on the world stage when it won and hosted the 1996 Summer Olympics. The Games impacted Atlanta\\u0027s development growth into the 21st century, and significantly sparked investment in the city\\u0027s universities, parks, and tourism industry. The gentrification of some of its neighborhoods has intensified in the 21st century with the growth of the Atlanta Beltline.

The Dolphins compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league\\u0027s American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, a northern suburb of Miami. The team is owned by Stephen M. Ross. The Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Of the four AFC East teams, the Dolphins are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The Dolphins were also one of the first professional football teams in the southeast, along with the Atlanta Falcons.\\n\\nThe Dolphins were founded by Joe Robbie, an attorney and politician, and Danny Thomas, an actor and comedian. They began play in the AFL in 1966. The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the Miami Seahawks, who played in the All-America Football Conference in 1946, before becoming the first incarnation of the Baltimore Colts. For the first few years, the Dolphins\\u0027 full-time training camp and practice facilities were at Saint Andrew\\u0027s School, a private, boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. Miami joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 AFL\\u2013NFL merger.\\n\\nThe team played in its first Super Bowl in Super Bowl VI, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, 24\\u20133. The following year, the Dolphins completed the NFL\\u0027s only perfect season, culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular-season games, and all three of their playoff games, including Super Bowl VII. They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect regular season, and remain the only team to do so including playoffs since the AFL-NFL merger, the time known as the Super Bowl era. The next year, the Dolphins won Super Bowl VIII, becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX, losing both games.\\n\\nFor most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by Don Shula, the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback Dan Marino became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the 1999 season.\\n\\nSince Marino\\u0027s retirement, they have experienced mediocre levels of success and have just six playoff appearances (2000, 2001, 2008, 2016, 2022, and 2023) and two division titles (2000 and 2008) with one playoff win.

The team plays its home games at Highmark Stadium in Orchard Park, New York.  The Bills are the only NFL team to play their home games within the state of New York. \\n\\nFounded in 1959 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL), they joined the NFL in 1970 following the AFL\\u2013NFL merger. The Bills\\u0027 name is derived from an All-America Football Conference (AAFC) franchise from Buffalo that was in turn named after western frontiersman Buffalo Bill. Drawing much of its fanbase from Western New York and Southern Ontario, the Bills are the only NFL team that plays home games in the state of New York. The franchise is owned by Terry and Kim Pegula, who purchased the Bills after the death of the original owner Ralph Wilson in 2014.\\n\\nThe Bills won consecutive AFL Championships in 1964 and 1965, the only major professional sports championships from a team representing Buffalo. After joining the NFL, they struggled heavily during the 1970s before becoming perennial postseason contenders from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Their greatest success occurred between 1990 and 1993 when they appeared in a record four consecutive Super Bowls, an accomplishment often overshadowed by their losing each game. From the early 2000s to the mid-2010s, the Bills endured the longest playoff drought of 17 years in the four major North American professional sports, making them the last franchise in the four leagues to qualify for the postseason in the 21st century. They returned to consistent postseason contention by the late 2010s, although the Bills have not returned to the Super Bowl. Alongside the Minnesota Vikings, their four Super Bowl appearances are the most among NFL franchises that have not won the Super Bowl.\\nidentifier: b58a9d17-1a41-4b3e-a9b5-675c71ad7339\\nsubjectOf: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027CreativeWork\\u0027, \\u0027identifier\\u0027: \\u002789b38123-7417-4979-a30e-5256b5dc8e9d\\u0027}\\nurl: https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki?curid=4315\"}, {\"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"icon\": {\"code\": \"\\uf007\", \"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"face\": \"FontAwesome\"}, \"id\": \"abba3053-f5df-4a6d-a499-23ea50284c12\", \"label\": \"A.

Since reaching a peak of 1.85\\u00a0million at the 1950 census, Detroit\\u0027s population has declined by more than 65 percent.\\n\\nDetroit is a port on the Detroit River, one of the four major straits that connect the Great Lakes system to the St. Lawrence Seaway. The city anchors the third-largest regional economy in the Midwest and the 16th-largest in the United States. Detroit is best known as the center of the U.S. automotive industry, and the \\\"Big Three\\\" auto manufacturers\\u2014General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis North America (Chrysler)\\u2014are all headquartered in Metro Detroit. The Detroit Metropolitan Airport is among the most important hub airports in the United States. Detroit and its neighboring Canadian city Windsor constitute the second-busiest international crossing in North America, after San Diego\\u2013Tijuana.\\n\\nDetroit\\u0027s diverse culture has had both local and international influence, particularly in music, with the city giving rise to the genres of Motown and techno and playing an important role in the development of jazz, hip-hop, rock, and punk. The rapid growth of Detroit in its boom years resulted in a globally unique stock of architectural monuments and historic places. Since the 2000s, conservation efforts have managed to save many architectural pieces and achieve several large-scale revitalizations, including the restoration of several historic theaters and entertainment venues, high-rise renovations, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. An increasingly popular tourist destination, Detroit receives 16\\u00a0million visitors per year. In 2015, Detroit was named a \\\"City of Design\\\" by UNESCO, the first and only U.S. city to receive that designation.\\nidentifier: 6f1258a7-6901-4be3-9181-7fbcd53b9819\\nsubjectOf: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027CreativeWork\\u0027, \\u0027identifier\\u0027: \\u002789b38123-7417-4979-a30e-5256b5dc8e9d\\u0027}\\nurl: https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki?curid=8687\"}, {\"color\": \"#ff9896\", \"icon\": {\"code\": \"\\uf1ad\", \"color\": \"#ff9896\", \"face\": \"FontAwesome\"}, \"id\": \"989cdc91-3003-4a1d-803b-37ab451439cb\", \"label\": \"National Football League\", \"shape\": \"icon\", \"title\": \"ORGANIZATION [989cdc91-3003-4a1d-803b-37ab451439cb]\\nname: National Football League\\ndescription: The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league that consists of 32 teams, divided equally between the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). The NFL is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and the highest professional level of American football in the world. Each NFL season begins annually with a three-week preseason in August, followed by the 18-week regular season, which runs from early September to early January, with each team playing 17 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, seven teams from each conference, including four division winners and three wild card teams, advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament, which culminates in the Super Bowl, played in early February between the winners of the AFC and NFC championship games.\\n\\nThe NFL was formed in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA) before renaming itself the National Football League for the 1922 season. After initially determining champions through end-of-season standings, a playoff system was implemented in 1933 that culminated with the NFL Championship Game until 1966. Following an agreement to merge the NFL with the rival American Football League (AFL), the Super Bowl was first held in 1967 to determine a champion between the best teams from the two leagues and has remained as the final game of each NFL season since the merger was completed in 1970. The NFL is the wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue and the sports league with the most valuable teams. and is the most popular sports league in the United States. The Super Bowl is also among the most-watched sporting events in the world, with the individual games accounting for many of the most watched television programs in American history and all occupying the top five of Nielsen\\u0027s all-time most-watched U.S. television broadcasts by 2015. The NFL is headquartered in Midtown Manhattan.\\n\\nThe Green Bay Packers hold the most combined NFL championships with thirteen, winning nine titles before the Super Bowl era and four Super Bowls afterwards. Since the creation of the Super Bowl, the New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl victories at six each. The reigning league champions are the Kansas City Chiefs, who defeated the San Francisco 49ers by a score of 25\\u201322 in Super Bowl LVIII.\\nalternateName: NFL\\nidentifier: 989cdc91-3003-4a1d-803b-37ab451439cb\\nsubjectOf: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027CreativeWork\\u0027, \\u0027identifier\\u0027: \\u002789b38123-7417-4979-a30e-5256b5dc8e9d\\u0027}\\nurl: https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki?curid=21211\"}, {\"color\": \"#ff9896\", \"icon\": {\"code\": \"\\uf1ad\", \"color\": \"#ff9896\", \"face\": \"FontAwesome\"}, \"id\": \"58fd13ff-6a4e-4154-b7a7-2246b297c2c5\", \"label\": \"University of Michigan\", \"shape\": \"icon\", \"title\": \"ORGANIZATION [58fd13ff-6a4e-4154-b7a7-2246b297c2c5]\\nname: University of Michigan\\ndescription: The University of Michigan (U-M, UMich, or simply Michigan) is a public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

It is the seat of King County, Washington. With a 2023 population of 755,078 Its growth rate of 21.1% between 2010 and 2020 made it one of the country\\u0027s fastest-growing large cities.\\n\\nSeattle is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and Lake Washington. It is the northernmost major city in the United States, located about  south of the Canadian border. A gateway for trade with East Asia, the Port of Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling .\\n\\nThe Seattle area has been inhabited by Native Americans (such as the Duwamish, who had at least 17 villages around Elliot Bay) for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner \\u0027\\u0027Exact\\u0027\\u0027 at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay in 1852 and named \\\"Seattle\\\" in honor of Chief Seattle, a prominent 19th-century leader of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. Seattle currently has high populations of Native Americans alongside Americans with strong Asian, African, European, and Scandinavian ancestry, and, as of 2015, hosts the fifth-largest LGBT community in the U.S.\\n\\nLogging was Seattle\\u0027s first major industry, but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. The city grew after World War II, partly due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for its manufacturing of aircraft.\\n\\nBeginning in the 1980s, the Seattle area developed into a technology center; Microsoft established its headquarters in the region. In 1994, Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle, and Alaska Airlines is based in SeaTac, Washington, serving Seattle\\u2013Tacoma International Airport, Seattle\\u0027s international airport. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city\\u0027s population by almost 50,000 in the decade between 1990 and 2000.\\n\\nThe culture of Seattle is heavily defined by its significant musical history. Between 1918 and 1951, nearly 24 jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ernestine Anderson, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and others. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the city also was the origin of several rock bands, including Foo Fighters, Heart, and Jimi Hendrix, and the subgenre of grunge and its pioneering bands, including Alice in Chains, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and others.\\nidentifier: ed9321a3-cf8d-4454-83f2-ba60d01c3aa7\\nsubjectOf: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027CreativeWork\\u0027, \\u0027identifier\\u0027: \\u002789b38123-7417-4979-a30e-5256b5dc8e9d\\u0027}\\nurl: https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki?curid=11388236\"}, {\"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"icon\": {\"code\": \"\\uf007\", \"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"face\": \"FontAwesome\"}, \"id\": \"d6e60abd-bad3-44ee-9dd9-5b93f3a2bbd6\", \"label\": \"J.

In 1848, at the end of the Mexican\\u2013American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city. The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.\\n\\nLos Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of industries.

Thus, Microsoft provides updates only to currently supported versions of Windows.

The Raiders compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league\\u0027s American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The team plays home games at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, and is headquartered in Henderson, Nevada.\\n\\nFounded on January 30, 1960, and originally based in Oakland, California,  the Raiders played their first regular season game on September 11, 1960, as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). They moved to the NFL with the AFL\\u2013NFL merger in 1970. The team was almost chosen under the nickname \\\"Se\\u00f1ors\\\" when established, as close to the team sporting the \\\"Oakland Se\\u00f1ors\\\" team name is the original idea of the orange and black team theme colors, that were discontinued as well. The team departed Oakland to play in Los Angeles from the 1982 season through the 1994 season before returning to Oakland at the start of the 1995 season. On March 27, 2017, NFL team owners voted nearly unanimously to approve the Raiders\\u0027 application to relocate to Las Vegas. Nearly three years later, on January 22, 2020, the Raiders moved to Las Vegas.\\n\\nThe Raiders\\u0027 on-field fortunes have varied considerably over the years. The team\\u0027s first three years of operation (1960\\u20131962) were marred by poor performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In 1963, the Raiders\\u0027 fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) Al Davis. In 1967, after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) AFL Championship that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to Super Bowl II, where they were soundly defeated by the Green Bay Packers. Since 1963, the team has won 15 division titles (3 AFL and 12 NFL), 4 AFC Championships (1976, 1980, 1983, and 2002), one AFL Championship (1967), and three Super Bowl Championships: XI (1976), XV (1980), and XVIII (1983). As of the end of the NFL\\u0027s 2023 season, the Raiders have an all-time regular season record of 505 wins, 467 losses, and 11 ties; their all-time playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 20 losses.\\n\\nAl Davis owned the team from 1972 until his death in 2011. Control of the franchise was then given to Al\\u0027s son Mark Davis, with Al\\u0027s wife Carol maintaining ownership. The Raiders are known for their extensive fan base and distinctive team culture. The Raiders have had 17 former players who have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame as well as two former coaches and Al Davis. They have previously played at Kezar Stadium and Candlestick Park in San Francisco, Frank Youell Field and Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, and the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles.\\nidentifier: cd0018a9-4b44-4a29-b6f9-d699e1163403\\nsubjectOf: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027CreativeWork\\u0027, \\u0027identifier\\u0027: \\u002789b38123-7417-4979-a30e-5256b5dc8e9d\\u0027}\\nurl: https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki?curid=22312\\nfoundingDate: 1960-01-30\"}, {\"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"icon\": {\"code\": \"\\uf007\", \"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"face\": \"FontAwesome\"}, \"id\": \"b1c798ae-9768-4254-9121-f562d308ace9\", \"label\": \"K.

The Browns compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team is named after original coach and co-founder Paul Brown. They play their home games at Huntington Bank Field, which opened in 1999, with administrative offices and training facilities in Berea, Ohio. The franchise\\u0027s official club colors are brown, orange, and white. They are unique among the 32 member clubs of the NFL in that they do not have a logo on their helmets.\\n\\nThe franchise was founded in 1944 by Brown and businessman Arthur B. McBride as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), and began play in 1946. The Browns dominated the AAFC, compiling a 47\\u20134\\u20133 record in the league\\u0027s four seasons and winning its championship in each.  When the AAFC folded after the 1949 season, the Browns joined the NFL along with the San Francisco 49ers and the original Baltimore Colts. The Browns won a championship in their inaugural NFL season, as well as in the 1954, 1955, and 1964 seasons, and in a feat unequaled in any of the North American major professional sports, played in their league championship game in each of their first 10 years of existence, winning seven of those games. From 1965 to 1995, they qualified to play in the NFL playoffs 14 times, but did not win another championship or play in the Super Bowl during that period.\\n\\nIn 1995, owner Art Modell, who had purchased the Browns in 1961, announced plans to move the team to Baltimore. After threats of legal action from the city of Cleveland and fans, a compromise was reached in early 1996 that allowed Modell to establish the Baltimore Ravens as a new franchise while retaining the contracts of all Browns personnel. The Browns\\u0027 intellectual property, including team name, logos, training facility, and history, were kept in trust and the franchise was regarded by the NFL as suspended, guaranteed to return no later than the 1999 season, either by relocation of an existing franchise or an expansion draft. While several of the existing franchises at the time considered relocating to Cleveland, in 1998 it was confirmed that the NFL would hold an expansion draft and field 31 teams when the Browns resumed play in 1999. And although the 1999 Browns were restocked via an expansion draft, the Browns are not considered to be an expansion franchise.\\n\\nSince resuming operations in 1999, the Browns have struggled to find success, especially during the 2010s when they did not post one winning season throughout that decade. They have had only four winning seasons (2002, 2007, 2020, and 2023), three playoff appearances (2002, 2020, and 2023), and one playoff win (2020), winning less than one third of their games in total, and in 2017 were only the second team in NFL history to have a 0\\u201316 season after the 2008 Detroit Lions. The franchise has also been noted for a lack of stability with head coaches (10 full time - including two who were fired after only one season - and two interim since 1999) and quarterbacks (38 different starters since 1999). From 2003 to 2019, the Browns had a 17-season playoff drought, which ended during the 2020 season.

He made detailed maps of Newfoundland prior to making three voyages to the Pacific, during which he achieved the first recorded European contact with the eastern coastline of Australia and the Hawaiian Islands and the first recorded circumnavigation of New Zealand.\\n\\nCook joined the British merchant navy as a teenager and joined the Royal Navy in 1755. He served during the Seven Years\\u0027 War and subsequently surveyed and mapped much of the entrance to the St. Lawrence River during the siege of Quebec, which brought him to the attention of the Admiralty and the Royal Society. This acclaim came at a crucial moment for the direction of British overseas exploration, and it led to his commission in 1768 as commander of  for the first of three Pacific voyages.\\n\\nIn these voyages, Cook sailed thousands of miles across largely uncharted areas of the globe. He mapped lands from New Zealand to Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean in greater detail and on a scale not previously charted by Western explorers. He surveyed and named features, and recorded islands and coastlines on European maps for the first time. He displayed a combination of seamanship, superior surveying and cartographic skills, physical courage, and an ability to lead men in adverse conditions.\\n\\nDuring his third voyage in the Pacific, Cook encountered the Hawaiian islands in 1779. He was killed while attempting to take hostage Kalani\\u0027\\u014dpu\\u0027u, chief of the island of Hawaii, during a dispute. He left a legacy of scientific and geographical knowledge that influenced his successors well into the 20th century, and numerous memorials worldwide have been dedicated to him. He remains controversial for his occasionally violent encounters with indigenous peoples and there is debate on whether he can be held responsible for paving the way for British imperialism and colonialism.\\nidentifier: 853ed3dd-de7b-4aa6-8a20-cfbfcf54bd53\\nsubjectOf: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027CreativeWork\\u0027, \\u0027identifier\\u0027: \\u002789b38123-7417-4979-a30e-5256b5dc8e9d\\u0027}\\nurl: https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki?curid=15630\\naffiliation: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027SportsTeam\\u0027, \\u0027identifier\\u0027: \\u0027011f399a-fe2a-4919-a7c4-a94f880bcca8\\u0027}\\nalumniOf: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027EducationalOrganization\\u0027}\\nfamilyName: Cook\\ngivenName: James\\nhasOccupation: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027Occupation\\u0027, \\u0027name\\u0027: \\u0027Explorer, cartographer and naval officer\\u0027}\"}, {\"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"icon\": {\"code\": \"\\uf007\", \"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"face\": \"FontAwesome\"}, \"id\": \"ce41dd63-025a-4f2c-9ed3-3200bb30fda9\", \"label\": \"Keon Coleman\", \"shape\": \"icon\", \"title\": \"PERSON [ce41dd63-025a-4f2c-9ed3-3200bb30fda9]\\nname: Keon Coleman\\ndescription: Keon Coleman (born May 17, 2003) is an American professional football wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL).

With a population of 383,997 according to the 2020 U.S. census, it is the most populous city in Louisiana and the French Louisiana region; third most populous city in the Deep South; and the twelfth-most populous city in the southeastern United States. Serving as a major port, New Orleans is considered an economic and commercial hub for the broader Gulf Coast region of the United States.\\n\\nNew Orleans is world-renowned for its distinctive music, Creole cuisine, unique dialects, and its annual celebrations and festivals, most notably Mardi Gras. The historic heart of the city is the French Quarter, known for its French and Spanish Creole architecture and vibrant nightlife along Bourbon Street. The city has been described as the \\\"most unique\\\" in the United States, owing in large part to its cross-cultural and multilingual heritage. Additionally, New Orleans has increasingly been known as \\\"Hollywood South\\\" due to its prominent role in the film industry and in pop culture.\\n\\nFounded in 1718 by French colonists, New Orleans was once the territorial capital of French Louisiana before becoming part of the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. New Orleans in 1840 was the third most populous city in the United States, and it was the largest city in the American South from the Antebellum era until after World War II. The city has historically been very vulnerable to flooding, due to its high rainfall, low lying elevation, poor natural drainage, and proximity to multiple bodies of water. State and federal authorities have installed a complex system of levees and drainage pumps in an effort to protect the city.\\n\\nNew Orleans was severely affected by Hurricane Katrina in late August 2005, which flooded more than 80% of the city, killed more than 1,800 people, and displaced thousands of residents, causing a population decline of over 50%. Since Katrina, major redevelopment efforts have led to a rebound in the city\\u0027s population. Concerns have been expressed about gentrification, new residents buying property in formerly close-knit communities, and displacement of longtime residents. Additionally, high rates of violent crime continue to plague the city with New Orleans experiencing 280 murders in 2022, resulting in the highest per capita homicide rate in the United States.\\n\\nThe city and Orleans Parish () are coterminous.

The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league\\u0027s American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The club\\u0027s home games are held in downtown Cincinnati at Paycor Stadium.\\n\\nFormer Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati\\u0027s city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season. Brown was the Bengals\\u0027 head coach from their inception to . After being dismissed as the Browns\\u0027 head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in ) in January , Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball\\u0027s Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the  season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than  away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season. After Paul Brown\\u0027s death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.\\n\\nThe Bengals won the AFC championship in , , and in . After the first two conference championships, they lost to the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The 1990s and the early 2000s were a period of great struggle. During that era they were occasionally referred to as \\\"The Bungles,\\\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope, due to their struggles and poor performance. Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without posting a winning record, during which time the team did not qualify to play in the NFL playoffs. The Bengals had several head coaches, and several of their top draft picks did not pan out. The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is often, though incorrectly, referred to as the Bengals\\u0027 general manager because he handles most personnel decisions. In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports. The team\\u0027s fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and they continued up until the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle past the regular season. The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and made back-to-back AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27\\u201324 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, but this time, they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23\\u201320. The following season in 2022, they also made the AFC Championship game but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, at the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI.\\n\\nIn a \\u0027\\u0027Forbes\\u0027\\u0027 article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.\\nidentifier: 5abe2b93-c5a3-4cea-88f5-598aec48a78c\\nsubjectOf: {\\u0027@type\\u0027: \\u0027CreativeWork\\u0027, \\u0027identifier\\u0027: \\u002789b38123-7417-4979-a30e-5256b5dc8e9d\\u0027}\\nurl: https://en.wikipedia.org:443/wiki?curid=6612\\nfoundingDate: 1967-05-23\"}, {\"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"icon\": {\"code\": \"\\uf007\", \"color\": \"#98df8a\", \"face\": \"FontAwesome\"}, \"id\": \"1f0a965c-afb0-45f6-8884-b979cd1f0982\", \"label\": \"Isaiah Likely\", \"shape\": \"icon\", \"title\": \"PERSON [1f0a965c-afb0-45f6-8884-b979cd1f0982]\\nname: Isaiah Likely\\ndescription: Isaiah Leroy Likely (born April 18, 2000) is an American professional football tight end for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL).

            "text/markdown": "**Assistant:**\nThe 2024 NFL season kicked off with some unfortunate injury news in Week 1. Most notably, Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love suffered an apparent lower leg injury in the final seconds of their game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Brazil. Further medical evaluation revealed Love sustained a sprained MCL, with an expected recovery timeline of 3-6 weeks.\n\nA sprained MCL, or medial collateral ligament, is a common knee injury for football players. It involves stretching or tearing of the ligament on the inner part of the knee. While not as severe as an ACL tear, it can still sideline players for several weeks depending on the grade of the sprain. Love's injury is particularly impactful as he was set to be the Packers' starting quarterback this season after taking over from Aaron Rodgers.\n\nThe injury to Love occurred in a historic setting - the NFL's first-ever game played in Brazil. The international matchup between the Packers and Eagles at São Paulo's Corinthians Arena was part of the league's efforts to expand its global reach. Unfortunately, the excitement of this milestone game was somewhat overshadowed by the injury to Green Bay's young quarterback.\n\nWhile Love's injury was the most significant reported from Week 1, it's worth noting that the NFL's injury reports are typically more comprehensive after all games have concluded. Teams and medical staff often need time to fully evaluate players and determine the extent of any injuries sustained during gameplay.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals were likely watching their quarterback Joe Burrow closely in Week 1, given his return from wrist surgery that sidelined him for a significant portion of the 2023 season. While no new injuries were reported for Burrow, his performance and durability will be closely monitored throughout the season.\n\nInjuries are an unfortunate reality in the NFL, and Week 1 often sees a higher rate of injuries as players readjust to the intensity of regular-season play after the preseason. Teams must now navigate these early setbacks while maintaining their competitive edge in the long 18-week season ahead.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders, now entering their fourth season in their new home city, will be hoping to avoid the injury bug that has plagued them in recent years. As a franchise with a storied history dating back to 1960, the Raiders have seen their fair share of season-altering injuries and will be aiming to keep their key players healthy as they compete in the tough AFC West division.\n\nFor teams like the Houston Texans and Carolina Panthers, who are looking to rebuild and improve upon previous disappointing seasons, avoiding major injuries to key players will be crucial. Both franchises are among the youngest in the NFL and are still in the process of establishing themselves as consistent contenders."

In the final seconds of their game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Brazil, Love suffered an apparent lower leg injury that was later diagnosed as a sprained MCL. This injury is expected to sideline Love for 3-6 weeks, dealing an early blow to the Packers' season hopes.\n\nLove's injury is particularly impactful given his status as the Packers' new starting quarterback following Aaron Rodgers' departure. The sprained MCL, which affects the medial collateral ligament on the inner part of the knee, can significantly impact a quarterback's mobility and ability to plant and throw. Green Bay will now have to navigate the next few weeks with a backup quarterback at the helm.\n\nThe timing of Love's injury is especially unfortunate, as it occurred in a historic setting - the NFL's first-ever game in Brazil. The match took place in Sao Paulo, marking a significant milestone in the league's international expansion efforts. The injury put a damper on what was otherwise an exciting, high-scoring affair that showcased the NFL's appeal to a new market.\n\nWhile Jordan Love's injury was the most notable, it's worth mentioning that the first week of an NFL season often sees a higher rate of injuries as players readjust to the intensity of regular-season play. The long flights to Brazil for both the Packers and Eagles may have also contributed to the physical stress on players, potentially increasing injury risk.\n\nOn a positive note, the New York Jets saw the return of quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who had missed the entire 2023 season due to an Achilles tear. Rodgers' comeback is a testament to modern medical advancements and rehabilitation techniques, allowing him to return to the field just a year after what was once considered a potentially career-ending injury.\n\nAnother quarterback making a return from injury in Week 1 was Joe Burrow of the Cincinnati Bengals. Burrow had missed a significant portion of the 2023 season due to wrist surgery. His performance in the season opener was closely watched to gauge whether he had fully recovered and could return to his previous form as one of the league's top young quarterbacks.\n\nThe NFL's focus on player safety has been a major topic in recent years, with rule changes and improved equipment designed to reduce the risk of injuries. However, the physical nature of football means that injuries remain an unfortunate reality of the sport. Teams must always be prepared with capable backups and adaptable game plans to navigate the challenges posed by player injuries.\n\nAs the 2024 season progresses, the impact of these early injuries will become clearer. For the Packers, the next few weeks will be crucial as they attempt to stay competitive in Love's absence. Meanwhile, other teams will be monitoring their own players' health closely, knowing that injuries can dramatically alter the course of a season in the highly competitive NFL landscape."
