            "# January 18: Support for content publishing, LLM tools, CLIP image embeddings, bug fixes\n",
            "### New Features\n",
            "\n",
            "- 💡 Graphlit now supports content publishing, where documents, audio transcripts and even image descriptions, can be summarized, and repurposed into blog posts, emails or AI-generated podcasts. With the new publishContents mutation, you can configure LLM prompts for summarization and publishing, and assign specifications to use different models and/or system prompts for each step in the process. The published content will be reingested into Graphlit, and can be searched or used for conversations, like any other form of content.\n",
            "- 💡 Graphlit now supports publishing conversations as content with the new publishConversation mutation. You can generate text or audio transcripts of your conversations, to be reused in other tools.\n",
            "- 💡 Graphlit now supports bulk summarization of contents with the summarizeContents mutation. You can filter a set of content, by feed, by observable or by similar text, and run a set of summarizations across each content in parallel.\n",
            "- 💡 Graphlit now supports LLM entity extraction, with the new MODEL_TEXT entity extraction service type. Similar to using Azure Cognitive Service Text Analytics, you can use any OpenAI or Anthropic model for extracting entities from text. Internally the LLM returns JSON-LD entities, which we convert into Person, Organization, Place, etc. entities and assign observations to the extracted content.\n",
            "- 💡 Graphlit now supports LLM tools (aka function calls) with OpenAI models. You can define the tools to be used with the LLM in the specification object. With the new extractContents mutation, you can execute a prompt against content using a specification with tools defined. The mutation will return the JSON arguments assigned by the LLM.\n",
            "- 💡 Graphlit now supports callback webhooks for LLM tools. If you assign a URI in the ToolDefinition object, Graphlit will call your webhook the tool name and JSON arguments. When you respond to the webhook with JSON, we will add that response to the LLM messages, and ask the LLM to complete the original prompt.\n",
            "- 💡 Graphlit now supports the selection of the Deepgram model (such as Meeting, Phonecall or Finance) with the preparation workflow. Also, you can assign your own Deepgram API key, which will be used for audio transcription using that workflow.\n",
            "- Added support for CLIP image embeddings using Roboflow, which can be used for similar image search. If you search for contents by similar contents, we will now use the content's text and/or image embeddings to find similar content.\n",
            "- Added support for dynamic web page ingestion. Graphlit now navigates to and automatically scrolls web pages using Browserless.io, so we capture the fully rendered HTML before extracting text. Also, we now support web page screenshots, if enabled with enableImageAnalysis property in preparation workflow. These screenshots can be analyzed with multimodal modals, such as GPT-4 Vision, or can be used to create image embeddings for similar image search.\n",
            "- Added table parsing when preparing documents. We now store structured (tab-delimited) text in the JSON text mezzanine which is extracted from documents in the preparation workflow.\n",
            "- Added reverse geocoding of lat/long locations found in image or other content metadata. We now store the real-world address with the content metadata, for use in conversations.\n",
            "- Added assistant messages to the conversation message history provided to the LLM. Originally we had included only user messages, but now we are formatting both user and assistant messages into the LLM prompt for conversations.\n",
            "- Added new chunking algorithm for text embeddings. We support semantic chunking at the page or transcript segment level, and now will create embeddings from smaller sized text chunks per page or segment.\n",
            "- Added content metadata to text and image embeddings. To provide better context for the text embeddings, we now include formatted content metadata, which includes fields like title, subject, author, or description. For emails, we include to, from, cc, and bcc fields.\n",
            "- Added helper mutations isContentDone and isFeedDone which can be used for polling completion of ingested content, or all content ingested by a feed.\n",
            "- Added richer image descriptions generated by the GPT-4 Vision model. Now these provide more useful detail.\n",
            "- Added validation of extracted hyperlinks. Now we test the URIs and remove any inaccessible links during content enrichment.\n",
            "- Added deleteContents, deleteFeeds, and deleteConversations mutations for multi-deletion of contents, feeds or conversations.\n",
            "- Added deleteAllContents, deleteAllFeeds, and deleteAllConversations mutations for bulk, filtered deletion of entities. You can delete all your contents, feeds, or conversations in your project, or a filtered subset of those entities.\n",
            "- ℹ️ Starter tier now has a higher content limit of 100K content items.\n",
            "- ⚡ In the OpenAIImageExtractionProperties type, the detailMode field was renamed to detailLevel.\n",
            "- ⚡ Each SummarizationStrategy object now accepts the specification which is used by the summarization, rather than being assigned at the preparation workflow stage.\n",
            "- ⚡ addCollectionContents and removeCollectionContents mutations have been deprecated in favor of addContentsToCollections and removeContentsFromCollection mutations.\n",

            "- 💡 Graphlit now automatically extracts embedded images in PDF files, ingests them as content objects, and links them as children of the parent PDF.\n",
            "- 💡 Graphlit now supports recursive Notion feeds. When the isRecursive flag is true in the Notion feed properties, we will crawl child pages and databases, and recursively ingest them in addition to the specified pages and databases.\n",
            "- Added support for assigning collections to content ingested with the ingestPage, ingestFile or ingestText mutations. This saves a step where the content will automatically be added to the collection(s) without requiring another mutation call.\n",
            "- Added support for the CODE file type for a wide variety of source code formats, i.e. Python .py, Javascript .js. Code files use optimized text splitting for enhanced search and retrieval.\n",
            "- Added support for customGuidance in Specification object, which can be used for injecting a guidance prompt during the RAG process. For example, you can instruct the LLM to return a default response string if no content sources are found via semantic search.\n",
            "- Added tenants field to Project object, which returns a list of all tenant IDs which have been used to create an entity in Graphlit.\n",
            "- Added email metadata, separate from document metadata. Now emails will contain indexed metadata such as to, from, or subject.\n",
            "- ⚡ The contents field for content objects has been replaced with children and parent fields. For example, when a ZIP file is unpacked, the unpacked files will be added as children of the ZIP file, and the ZIP file will be the parent of each of the unpacked files.\n",

            "text/markdown": "[00:00:00] Hello, everyone,\n\n[00:00:01] and welcome to a special year in review for the Graphlet platform.\n\n[00:00:06] It's been an incredible stretch of milestones\n\n[00:00:10] and enhancements\n\n[00:00:11] all designed to make your development workflow simpler,\n\n[00:00:14] more powerful,\n\n[00:00:15] and more creative.\n\n[00:00:18] Let's explore how each month's updates can help you, whether you're coding in Python, dot net, JavaScript, or any other environment.\n\n[00:00:27] Let's start back in July 2023.\n\n[00:00:31] One key addition was SharePoint feed support, allowing direct file ingestion from SharePoint libraries.\n\n[00:00:37] This came with new conversation features, such as timestamped messages\n\n[00:00:42] to help keep your discussions organized and relevant.\n\n[00:00:45] These upgrades reduced friction when pulling in data from corporate SharePoint,\n\n[00:00:50] making you more efficient in building knowledge based applications.\n\n[00:00:54] Moving into August 2023,\n\n[00:00:56] Grafler introduced a new data model for observations,\n\n[00:01:00] enabling more structured ways to track entities like people or organizations.\n\n[00:01:06] Then came a direct text ingestion for plain text, markdown,\n\n[00:01:10] or HTML,\n\n[00:01:11] eliminating the need for a file or URL.\n\n[00:01:14] This is perfect when you just want to send raw data into Graphlet and get back structured content or embeddings for analysis.\n\n[00:01:23] Also, in August, usage based billing infrastructure was rolled out.\n\n[00:01:27] While still offering a free tier to get started right away, it set the stage for future expansions of credit based\n\n[00:01:34] usage, helpful for devs who prefer pay as you go models.\n\n[00:01:39] September 2023\n\n[00:01:40] ushered in a wave of productivity features.\n\n[00:01:43] Workflow configuration\n\n[00:01:44] let you define how your content passes through ingestion,\n\n[00:01:48] enrichment, or summarization\n\n[00:01:49] steps with support for Notion feeds to quickly import your team's notes and pages.\n\n[00:01:56] Paid subscription plans also launched, providing hobby, starter,\n\n[00:02:00] and growth tiers,\n\n[00:02:02] each with different quotas.\n\n[00:02:04] For those who love video content, YouTube feed support arrived,\n\n[00:02:09] complete with automatic transcription for ingesting the audio.\n\n[00:02:13] Now your dev team can treat video content just like any text document\n\n[00:02:18] and search or summarize it with ease.\n\n[00:02:21] October\n\n[00:02:22] 2023\n\n[00:02:23] focused on deeper language model integrations.\n\n[00:02:26] Anthropic Claude models joined the party for advanced text completions,\n\n[00:02:30] while Slack feed ingestion\n\n[00:02:33] made it easier for your dev teams to bring chat messages\n\n[00:02:36] and file attachments\n\n[00:02:37] into the knowledge base.\n\n[00:02:40] The platform also\n\n[00:02:41] expanded entity enrichment,\n\n[00:02:44] letting you layer in details from sources like Wikipedia\n\n[00:02:47] or Crunchbase.\n\n[00:02:49] By the end of the month,\n\n[00:02:51] conversation responses were further optimized, and you could add aliases to your observed entities,\n\n[00:02:56] especially handy when there are multiple ways to refer to the same person or place.\n\n[00:03:02] December\n\n[00:03:03] 2023\n\n[00:03:03] brought some major model updates.\n\n[00:03:06] The platform introduced OpenAI GPT 4 Turbo with a 128\n\n[00:03:11] k token window and also added llama 2, Mistral, and anthropic Claude 2.1.\n\n[00:03:19] All these models expand your options for generating text,\n\n[00:03:22] summarizing content, or performing semantic searches.\n\n[00:03:27] There was also support for query by example,\n\n[00:03:30] letting you simply submit a sample snippet of text or conversation to find related content.\n\n[00:03:37] Jumping into January 2024,\n\n[00:03:39] new content publishing features transformed how you repurpose\n\n[00:03:43] and summarize documents,\n\n[00:03:45] audio transcripts,\n\n[00:03:46] and images.\n\n[00:03:49] LLM tools, including function calls in OpenAI models,\n\n[00:03:53] make it simpler to integrate prompt driven tasks directly into your code.\n\n[00:03:59] Additionally, Google and Microsoft email feeds became 1st class citizens,\n\n[00:04:03] enabling ingestion of both historic and new emails,\n\n[00:04:07] attachments included.\n\n[00:04:10] That month also introduced reingestion capabilities\n\n[00:04:13] so you can update existing content in place with minimal fuss.\n\n[00:04:18] February\n\n[00:04:19] 2024\n\n[00:04:20] introduced semantic alerts\n\n[00:04:22] for automatically generating daily or periodic summaries,\n\n[00:04:26] perfect for receiving quick bulletins on everything new in your workspace.\n\n[00:04:31] OneDrive and Google Drive feed support was expanded,\n\n[00:04:35] including the ability to ingest images\n\n[00:04:38] from PDFs or to capture embedded image\n\n[00:04:41] images in your documents.\n\n[00:04:43] These features cut down on tedious overhead\n\n[00:04:46] so you can focus on building robust apps.\n\n[00:04:50] March 2 24 saw comprehensive usage and credits telemetry\n\n[00:04:55] so you can monitor precisely how many tokens or data credits your team is using.\n\n[00:05:01] For devs who prefer command line utilities,\n\n[00:05:04] a new CLI tool was released for efficient graphlet data\n\n[00:05:08] API interactions.\n\n[00:05:10] Further in March came support for additional issue tracking feeds,\n\n[00:05:14] linear, GitHub issues, and Jira,\n\n[00:05:17] turning your project tickets into fully searchable items.\n\n[00:05:21] And for file management, you could now ingest base 64 encoded files directly.\n\n[00:05:28] April 2024\n\n[00:05:30] was all about chat and ingestion flows.\n\n[00:05:33] Discord feed support arrived,\n\n[00:05:35] letting you bring chat messages\n\n[00:05:37] and attached media directly into Graphlet.\n\n[00:05:40] Cohere re ranking and improved text chunking\n\n[00:05:43] enhanced the retrieval augmented generation pipeline.\n\n[00:05:47] Most notably, native SDKs in Python and TypeScript\n\n[00:05:51] came out later in April.\n\n[00:05:53] Code generated from the GraphQL schema, so you no longer need to be a GraphQL expert to start building.\n\n[00:06:00] There were also brand new model integrations for OpenAI's\n\n[00:06:04] g GPT\n\n[00:06:05] 4 expansions\n\n[00:06:07] as well as support for advanced\n\n[00:06:09] and coherent models.\n\n[00:06:11] May 2024\n\n[00:06:13] introduced new re ranking services from Jina and Pongo,\n\n[00:06:17] plus the brand new graphRAG feature,\n\n[00:06:19] a system that harnesses extracted entities to supercharge your your retrieval augmented generation workflow.\n\n[00:06:27] Open AI GPT 4 o replaced Azure Open AI GPT 3.5,\n\n[00:06:33] 16 k as the default model,\n\n[00:06:35] promising a more robust experience.\n\n[00:06:38] For Microsoft Teams fans, feed support allowed you to ingest channel messages automatically\n\n[00:06:44] while performance optimizations\n\n[00:06:46] in entity extraction boosted speeds for large datasets.\n\n[00:06:51] In June 2024,\n\n[00:06:53] developers gained the ability to pass embedded JSON LD data from web pages,\n\n[00:06:59] enriching\n\n[00:07:00] your knowledge graph with schema.org\n\n[00:07:02] or other structured data.\n\n[00:07:05] Deep seek model support was introduced. So\n\n[00:07:08] if you prefer their AI completions and coders,\n\n[00:07:11] you have that option too.\n\n[00:07:14] Then in late June came the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model and semantic search for observable entities,\n\n[00:07:21] a boon for advanced knowledge graph queries when dealing with people,\n\n[00:07:26] organizations,\n\n[00:07:27] or places.\n\n[00:07:29] July 2024\n\n[00:07:31] was packed.\n\n[00:07:33] Webhook alerts went live,\n\n[00:07:35] enabling automatic notifications when new content is published,\n\n[00:07:39] and the deep seek 128 k token context was introduced\n\n[00:07:43] to handle giant transcripts or text blocks in a single pass.\n\n[00:07:48] Then soon after, gpt4\n\n[00:07:50] o Mini arrived,\n\n[00:07:52] offering a more lightweight\n\n[00:07:54] gpt4\n\n[00:07:55] variant for faster completions.\n\n[00:07:57] Updates to Mistral Large 2 and Nemo\n\n[00:08:00] plus new GrokLama\n\n[00:08:02] 3.1 models delivered even more alternatives to handle your AI workloads.\n\n[00:08:07] The next update introduced an indexing workflow stage and Azure AI language detection\n\n[00:08:14] so you can automatically detect and store the languages a piece of content is written in.\n\n[00:08:20] In August 2024,\n\n[00:08:22] the platform unveiled an open source dotnet SDK on Nougat,\n\n[00:08:26] giving\n\n[00:08:27] Csearchiles developers\n\n[00:08:28] first class\n\n[00:08:30] access to the Graphlet APIs.\n\n[00:08:33] Document preparation\n\n[00:08:34] switched to Azure AI document intelligence by default,\n\n[00:08:38] boosting accuracy for complex PDFs.\n\n[00:08:41] Medical entities were also added,\n\n[00:08:44] letting you extract detailed references\n\n[00:08:46] to medical conditions,\n\n[00:08:48] drugs, or procedures.\n\n[00:08:50] Meanwhile, anthropic prompt caching\n\n[00:08:53] reduced token costs,\n\n[00:08:55] speeding up repeated queries.\n\n[00:08:58] September 24 stepped up the AI model offerings further with FHIR enrichment for health care data and the newly updated Coherent models.\n\n[00:09:08] Google AI search feeds and Cerebras model support also landed,\n\n[00:09:12] plus more advanced grok llama versions.\n\n[00:09:15] By now, you could combine advanced conversation prompts with fallback retrieval of relevant content,\n\n[00:09:22] ensuring your AI app stays robust even if the main model hits a snag.\n\n[00:09:26] October 2, 2024 introduced a flurry of tool calling capabilities\n\n[00:09:31] across Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, and more.\n\n[00:09:36] This let large language models handle tasks by calling external tools in real time, bridging the gap between pure text generation\n\n[00:09:45] and practical app logic.\n\n[00:09:47] GitHub repository feeds also debuted so you can auto ingest code files\n\n[00:09:52] while conversation interactions got new ways to simulate tool calls or to pass tool responses from JSON.\n\n[00:10:00] November\n\n[00:10:01] 2024\n\n[00:10:02] delivered web search features.\n\n[00:10:04] Imagine searching the open web,\n\n[00:10:06] retrieving\n\n[00:10:07] relevant pages,\n\n[00:10:09] and combining them with your content all in one shot.\n\n[00:10:14] Multi turn text summarization\n\n[00:10:16] and multi turn image analysis\n\n[00:10:18] made it possible to revise or refine a summary\n\n[00:10:22] over a series of LLM prompts.\n\n[00:10:24] Deepgram language detection took speech transcription to the next level,\n\n[00:10:29] and feed management was enhanced so you can control usage or upgrade easily when you run out of free tier credits.\n\n[00:10:36] Finally, December 2024\n\n[00:10:39] concluded with major expansions in the retrieval pipeline.\n\n[00:10:43] You can run a retrieval only rag process or map entire websites with the new site mapping features. Summaries and bullet points are more accurate than ever with refined chunking strategies.\n\n[00:10:54] And let's not forget the big arrival\n\n[00:10:56] of new model support for Grok Yammer\n\n[00:10:59] 3.3\n\n[00:11:00] or the ability to handle advanced content from Dropbox,\n\n[00:11:04] Box, Intercom,\n\n[00:11:05] Zendesk, and beyond.\n\n[00:11:08] Throughout these releases, loads of bugs were squashed\n\n[00:11:11] from synchronizing your search index in real time\n\n[00:11:14] to extracting images from PDFs\n\n[00:11:16] to properly handling text from every corner of your data sources.\n\n[00:11:21] Each fix was about giving you a more stable and confident development experience.\n\n[00:11:27] In short, the Graphlet platform has advanced leaps and bounds this past year.\n\n[00:11:33] From brand new SDKs\n\n[00:11:35] and improved content ingestion\n\n[00:11:37] to powerful LLM integrations\n\n[00:11:40] and next level conversation features, there's something here for every team building with AI.\n\n[00:11:46] The best way to learn more?\n\n[00:11:48] Try it.

year in review for the Graphlet platform.\\n\\n[00:00:06] It's been an incredible stretch of milestones\\n\\n[00:00:10] and enhancements\\n\\n[00:00:11] all designed to make your development workflow simpler,\\n\\n[00:00:14] more powerful,\\n\\n[00:00:15] and more creative.\\n\\n[00:00:18] Let's explore how each month's updates can help you, whether you're coding in Python, dot net, JavaScript, or any other environment.\\n\\n[00:00:27] Let's start back in July 2023.\\n\\n[00:00:31] One key addition was SharePoint feed support, allowing direct file ingestion from SharePoint libraries.\\n\\n[00:00:37] This came with new conversation features, such as timestamped messages\\n\\n[00:00:42] to help keep your discussions organized and relevant.\\n\\n[00:00:45] These upgrades reduced friction when pulling in data from corporate SharePoint,\\n\\n[00:00:50] making you more efficient in building knowledge based applications.\\n\\n[00:00:54] Moving into August 2023,\\n\\n[00:00:56] Grafler introduced a new data model for observations,\\n\\n[00:01:00] enabling more structured ways to track entities like people or organizations.\\n\\n[00:01:06] Then came a direct text ingestion for plain text, markdown,\\n\\n[00:01:10] or HTML,\\n\\n[00:01:11] eliminating the need for a file or URL.\\n\\n[00:01:14] This is perfect when you just want to send raw data into Graphlet and get back structured content or embeddings for analysis.\\n\\n[00:01:23] Also, in August, usage based billing infrastructure was rolled out.\\n\\n[00:01:27] While still offering a free tier to get started right away, it set the stage for future expansions of credit based\\n\\n[00:01:34] usage, helpful for devs who prefer pay as you go models.\\n\\n[00:01:39] September 2023\\n\\n[00:01:40] ushered in a wave of productivity features.\\n\\n[00:01:43] Workflow configuration\\n\\n[00:01:44] let you define how your content passes through ingestion,\\n\\n[00:01:48] enrichment, or summarization\\n\\n[00:01:49] steps with support for Notion feeds to quickly import your team's notes and pages.\\n\\n[00:01:56] Paid subscription plans also launched, providing hobby, starter,\\n\\n[00:02:00] and growth tiers,\\n\\n[00:02:02] each with different quotas.\\n\\n[00:02:04] For those who love video content, YouTube feed support arrived,\\n\\n[00:02:09] complete with automatic transcription for ingesting the audio.\\n\\n[00:02:13] Now your dev team can treat video content just like any text document\\n\\n[00:02:18] and search or summarize it with ease.\\n\\n[00:02:21] October\\n\\n[00:02:22] 2023\\n\\n[00:02:23] focused on deeper language model integrations.\\n\\n[00:02:26] Anthropic Claude models joined the party for advanced text completions,\\n\\n[00:02:30] while Slack feed ingestion\\n\\n[00:02:33] made it easier for your dev teams to bring chat messages\\n\\n[00:02:36] and file attachments\\n\\n[00:02:37] into the knowledge base.\\n\\n[00:02:40] The platform also\\n\\n[00:02:41] expanded entity enrichment,\\n\\n[00:02:44] letting you layer in details from sources like Wikipedia\\n\\n[00:02:47] or Crunchbase.\\n\\n[00:02:49] By the end of the month,\\n\\n[00:02:51] conversation responses were further optimized, and you could add aliases to your observed entities,\\n\\n[00:02:56] especially handy when there are multiple ways to refer to the same person or place.\\n\\n[00:03:02] December\\n\\n[00:03:03] 2023\\n\\n[00:03:03] brought some major model updates.\\n\\n[00:03:06] The platform introduced OpenAI GPT 4 Turbo with a 128\\n\\n[00:03:11] k token window and also added llama 2, Mistral, and anthropic Claude 2.1.\\n\\n[00:03:19] All these models expand your options for generating text,\\n\\n[00:03:22] summarizing content, or performing semantic searches.\\n\\n[00:03:27] There was also support for query by example,\\n\\n[00:03:30] letting you simply submit a sample snippet of text or conversation to find related content.\\n\\n[00:03:37] Jumping into January 2024,\\n\\n[00:03:39] new content publishing features transformed how you repurpose\\n\\n[00:03:43] and summarize documents,\\n\\n[00:03:45] audio transcripts,\\n\\n[00:03:46] and images.\\n\\n[00:03:49] LLM tools, including function calls in OpenAI models,\\n\\n[00:03:53] make it simpler to integrate prompt driven tasks directly into your code.\\n\\n[00:03:59] Additionally, Google and Microsoft email feeds became 1st class citizens,\\n\\n[00:04:03] enabling ingestion of both historic and new emails,\\n\\n[00:04:07] attachments included.\\n\\n[00:04:10] That month also introduced reingestion capabilities\\n\\n[00:04:13] so you can update existing content in place with minimal fuss.\\n\\n[00:04:18] February\\n\\n[00:04:19] 2024\\n\\n[00:04:20] introduced semantic alerts\\n\\n[00:04:22] for automatically generating daily or periodic summaries,\\n\\n[00:04:26] perfect for receiving quick bulletins on everything new in your workspace.\\n\\n[00:04:31] OneDrive and Google Drive feed support was expanded,\\n\\n[00:04:35] including the ability to ingest images\\n\\n[00:04:38] from PDFs or to capture embedded image\\n\\n[00:04:41] images in your documents.\\n\\n[00:04:43] These features cut down on tedious overhead\\n\\n[00:04:46] so you can focus on building robust apps.\\n\\n[00:04:50] March 2 24 saw comprehensive usage and credits telemetry\\n\\n[00:04:55] so you can monitor precisely how many tokens or data credits your team is using.\\n\\n[00:05:01] For devs who prefer command line utilities,\\n\\n[00:05:04] a new CLI tool was released for efficient graphlet data\\n\\n[00:05:08] API interactions.\\n\\n[00:05:10] Further in March came support for additional issue tracking feeds,\\n\\n[00:05:14] linear, GitHub issues, and Jira,\\n\\n[00:05:17] turning your project tickets into fully searchable items.\\n\\n[00:05:21] And for file management, you could now ingest base 64 encoded files directly.\\n\\n[00:05:28] April 2024\\n\\n[00:05:30] was all about chat and ingestion flows.\\n\\n[00:05:33] Discord feed support arrived,\\n\\n[00:05:35] letting you bring chat messages\\n\\n[00:05:37] and attached media directly into Graphlet.\\n\\n[00:05:40] Cohere re ranking and improved text chunking\\n\\n[00:05:43] enhanced the retrieval augmented generation pipeline.\\n\\n[00:05:47] Most notably, native SDKs in Python and TypeScript\\n\\n[00:05:51] came out later in April.\\n\\n[00:05:53] Code generated from the GraphQL schema, so you no longer need to be a GraphQL expert to start building.\\n\\n[00:06:00] There were also brand new model integrations for OpenAI's\\n\\n[00:06:04] g GPT\\n\\n[00:06:05] 4 expansions\\n\\n[00:06:07] as well as support for advanced\\n\\n[00:06:09] and coherent models.\\n\\n[00:06:11] May 2024\\n\\n[00:06:13] introduced new re ranking services from Jina and Pongo,\\n\\n[00:06:17] plus the brand new graphRAG feature,\\n\\n[00:06:19] a system that harnesses extracted entities to supercharge your your retrieval augmented generation workflow.\\n\\n[00:06:27] Open AI GPT 4 o replaced Azure Open AI GPT 3.5,\\n\\n[00:06:33] 16 k as the default model,\\n\\n[00:06:35] promising a more robust experience.\\n\\n[00:06:38] For Microsoft Teams fans, feed support allowed you to ingest channel messages automatically\\n\\n[00:06:44] while performance optimizations\\n\\n[00:06:46] in entity extraction boosted speeds for large datasets.\\n\\n[00:06:51] In June 2024,\\n\\n[00:06:53] developers gained the ability to pass embedded JSON LD data from web pages,\\n\\n[00:06:59] enriching\\n\\n[00:07:00] your knowledge graph with schema.org\\n\\n[00:07:02] or other structured data.\\n\\n[00:07:05] Deep seek model support was introduced. So\\n\\n[00:07:08] if you prefer their AI completions and coders,\\n\\n[00:07:11] you have that option too.\\n\\n[00:07:14] Then in late June came the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model and semantic search for observable entities,\\n\\n[00:07:21] a boon for advanced knowledge graph queries when dealing with people,\\n\\n[00:07:26] organizations,\\n\\n[00:07:27] or places.\\n\\n[00:07:29] July 2024\\n\\n[00:07:31] was packed.\\n\\n[00:07:33] Webhook alerts went live,\\n\\n[00:07:35] enabling automatic notifications when new content is published,\\n\\n[00:07:39] and the deep seek 128 k token context was introduced\\n\\n[00:07:43] to handle giant transcripts or text blocks in a single pass.\\n\\n[00:07:48] Then soon after, gpt4\\n\\n[00:07:50] o Mini arrived,\\n\\n[00:07:52] offering a more lightweight\\n\\n[00:07:54] gpt4\\n\\n[00:07:55] variant for faster completions.\\n\\n[00:07:57] Updates to Mistral Large 2 and Nemo\\n\\n[00:08:00] plus new GrokLama\\n\\n[00:08:02] 3.1 models delivered even more alternatives to handle your AI workloads.\\n\\n[00:08:07] The next update introduced an indexing workflow stage and Azure AI language detection\\n\\n[00:08:14] so you can automatically detect and store the languages a piece of content is written in.\\n\\n[00:08:20] In August 2024,\\n\\n[00:08:22] the platform unveiled an open source dotnet SDK on Nougat,\\n\\n[00:08:26] giving\\n\\n[00:08:27] Csearchiles developers\\n\\n[00:08:28] first class\\n\\n[00:08:30] access to the Graphlet APIs.\\n\\n[00:08:33] Document preparation\\n\\n[00:08:34] switched to Azure AI document intelligence by default,\\n\\n[00:08:38] boosting accuracy for complex PDFs.\\n\\n[00:08:41] Medical entities were also added,\\n\\n[00:08:44] letting you extract detailed references\\n\\n[00:08:46] to medical conditions,\\n\\n[00:08:48] drugs, or procedures.\\n\\n[00:08:50] Meanwhile, anthropic prompt caching\\n\\n[00:08:53] reduced token costs,\\n\\n[00:08:55] speeding up repeated queries.\\n\\n[00:08:58] September 24 stepped up the AI model offerings further with FHIR enrichment for health care data and the newly updated Coherent models.\\n\\n[00:09:08] Google AI search feeds and Cerebras model support also landed,\\n\\n[00:09:12] plus more advanced grok llama versions.\\n\\n[00:09:15] By now, you could combine advanced conversation prompts with fallback retrieval of relevant content,\\n\\n[00:09:22] ensuring your AI app stays robust even if the main model hits a snag.\\n\\n[00:09:26] October 2, 2024 introduced a flurry of tool calling capabilities\\n\\n[00:09:31] across Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, and more.\\n\\n[00:09:36] This let large language models handle tasks by calling external tools in real time, bridging the gap between pure text generation\\n\\n[00:09:45] and practical app logic.\\n\\n[00:09:47] GitHub repository feeds also debuted so you can auto ingest code files\\n\\n[00:09:52] while conversation interactions got new ways to simulate tool calls or to pass tool responses from JSON.\\n\\n[00:10:00] November\\n\\n[00:10:01] 2024\\n\\n[00:10:02] delivered web search features.\\n\\n[00:10:04] Imagine searching the open web,\\n\\n[00:10:06] retrieving\\n\\n[00:10:07] relevant pages,\\n\\n[00:10:09] and combining them with your content all in one shot.\\n\\n[00:10:14] Multi turn text summarization\\n\\n[00:10:16] and multi turn image analysis\\n\\n[00:10:18] made it possible to revise or refine a summary\\n\\n[00:10:22] over a series of LLM prompts.\\n\\n[00:10:24] Deepgram language detection took speech transcription to the next level,\\n\\n[00:10:29] and feed management was enhanced so you can control usage or upgrade easily when you run out of free tier credits.\\n\\n[00:10:36] Finally, December 2024\\n\\n[00:10:39] concluded with major expansions in the retrieval pipeline.\\n\\n[00:10:43] You can run a retrieval only rag process or map entire websites with the new site mapping features.

This came with new conversation features—such as timestamped messages—to help keep your discussions organized and relevant. These upgrades reduced friction when pulling in data from corporate SharePoint, making you more efficient in building knowledge-based applications.\n",

Then came direct text ingestion for plain text, Markdown, or HTML, eliminating the need for a file or URL. This is perfect when you just want to send raw data into Graphlit and get back structured content or embeddings for analysis. Also in August, usage-based billing infrastructure was rolled out. While still offering a free tier to get started right away, it set the stage for future expansions of credit-based usage—helpful for devs who prefer pay-as-you-go models.\n",

            "September 2023 ushered in a wave of productivity features. Workflow configuration let you define how your content passes through ingestion, enrichment, or summarization steps, with support for Notion feeds to quickly import your team’s notes and pages. Paid subscription plans also launched, providing Hobby, Starter, and Growth tiers, each with different quotas. For those who love video content, YouTube feed support arrived, complete with automatic transcription for ingesting the audio. Now your dev team can treat video content just like any text document and search or summarize it with ease.\n",
            "\n",
            "October 2023 focused on deeper language model integrations. Anthropic Claude models joined the party for advanced text completions, while Slack feed ingestion made it easier for your dev teams to bring chat messages and file attachments into the knowledge base. The platform also expanded entity enrichment, letting you layer in details from sources like Wikipedia or Crunchbase. By the end of the month, conversation responses were further optimized, and you could add aliases to your observed entities—especially handy when there are multiple ways to refer to the same person or place.\n",
            "\n",
            "December 2023 brought some major model updates. The platform introduced OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with a 128k token window and also added Llama 2, Mistral, and Anthropic Claude 2.1. All these models expand your options for generating text, summarizing content, or performing semantic searches. There was also support for query-by-example, letting you simply submit a sample snippet of text or conversation to find related content.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jumping into January 2024, new content publishing features transformed how you repurpose and summarize documents, audio transcripts, and images. LLM tools, including function calls in OpenAI models, make it simpler to integrate prompt-driven tasks directly into your code. Additionally, Google and Microsoft email feeds became first-class citizens, enabling ingestion of both historic and new emails—attachments included. That month also introduced reingestion capabilities so you can update existing content in place with minimal fuss.\n",
            "\n",
            "February 2024 introduced semantic alerts for automatically generating daily or periodic summaries, perfect for receiving quick bulletins on everything new in your workspace. OneDrive and Google Drive feed support was expanded, including the ability to ingest images from PDFs or to capture embedded images in your documents. These features cut down on tedious overhead so you can focus on building robust apps.\n",
            "\n",
            "March 2024 saw comprehensive usage and credits telemetry so you can monitor precisely how many tokens or data credits your team is using. For devs who prefer command-line utilities, a new CLI tool was released for efficient Graphlit Data API interactions. Further in March came support for additional issue-tracking feeds—Linear, GitHub Issues, and Jira—turning your project tickets into fully searchable items. And for file management, you could now ingest Base64-encoded files directly.\n",
            "\n",
            "April 2024 was all about chat and ingestion flows. Discord feed support arrived, letting you bring chat messages and attached media directly into Graphlit. Cohere reranking and improved text chunking enhanced the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline. Most notably, native SDKs in Python and TypeScript came out later in April, code-generated from the GraphQL schema, so you no longer need to be a GraphQL expert to start building. There were also brand-new model integrations for OpenAI’s GPT-4 expansions, as well as support for advanced LLaMA and Cohere Command models.\n",
            "\n",
            "May 2024 introduced new reranking services from Jina and Pongo, plus the brand-new GraphRAG feature—a system that harnesses extracted entities to supercharge your retrieval-augmented generation workflow. OpenAI GPT-4o replaced Azure OpenAI GPT-3.5 16k as the default model, promising a more robust experience. For Microsoft Teams fans, feed support allowed you to ingest channel messages automatically, while performance optimizations in entity extraction boosted speeds for large datasets.\n",
            "\n",
            "In June 2024, developers gained the ability to parse embedded JSON-LD data from web pages, enriching your knowledge graph with schema.org or other structured data. Deepseek model support was introduced, so if you prefer their AI completions and coders, you have that option too. Then in late June came the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model and semantic search for observable entities, a boon for advanced knowledge graph queries when dealing with people, organizations, or places.\n",
            "\n",
            "July 2024 was packed. Webhook Alerts went live, enabling automatic notifications when new content is published, and the Deepseek 128k token context was introduced—to handle giant transcripts or text blocks in a single pass. Then soon after, GPT-4o Mini arrived, offering a more lightweight GPT-4 variant for faster completions. Updates to Mistral Large 2 and Nemo, plus new Groq Llama 3.1 models, delivered even more alternatives to handle your AI workloads. The next update introduced an indexing workflow stage and Azure AI language detection, so you can automatically detect and store the languages a piece of content is written in.\n",
            "\n",
            "In August 2024, the platform unveiled an open source .NET SDK on NuGet, giving C# developers first-class access to the Graphlit APIs. Document preparation switched to Azure AI Document Intelligence by default, boosting accuracy for complex PDFs. Medical entities were also added, letting you extract detailed references to medical conditions, drugs, or procedures. Meanwhile, Anthropic prompt caching reduced token costs, speeding up repeated queries.\n",
            "\n",
            "September 2024 stepped up the AI model offerings further with FHIR enrichment for healthcare data and the newly updated Cohere models. Google AI search feeds and Cerebras model support also landed, plus more advanced Groq Llama versions. By now, you could combine advanced conversation prompts with fallback retrieval of relevant content, ensuring your AI app stays robust even if the main model hits a snag.\n",
            "\n",
            "October 2024 introduced a flurry of “tool calling” capabilities across Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, and more. This let large language models handle tasks by calling external tools in real time, bridging the gap between pure text generation and practical app logic. GitHub repository feeds also debuted so you can auto-ingest code files, while conversation interactions got new ways to simulate tool calls or to parse tool responses from JSON.\n",
            "\n",
            "November 2024 delivered web search features—imagine searching the open web, retrieving relevant pages, and combining them with your content, all in one shot. Multi-turn text summarization and multi-turn image analysis made it possible to revise or refine a summary over a series of LLM prompts. Deepgram language detection took speech transcription to the next level, and feed management was enhanced so you can control usage or upgrade easily when you run out of free-tier credits.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, December 2024 concluded with major expansions in the retrieval pipeline. You can run a retrieval-only RAG process, or map entire websites with the new site mapping features. Summaries and bullet points are more accurate than ever with refined chunking strategies. And let’s not forget the big arrival of new model support for Groq Llama 3.3, or the ability to handle advanced content from Dropbox, Box, Intercom, Zendesk, and beyond.\n",
            "\n",
            "Throughout these releases, loads of bugs were squashed—from synchronizing your search index in real time, to extracting images from PDFs, to properly handling text from every corner of your data sources. Each fix was about giving you a more stable and confident development experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "In short, the Graphlit Platform has advanced leaps and bounds this past year.

            "January 18: Support for content publishing, LLM tools, CLIP image embeddings, bug fixes\n",
            "New Features\n",
            "💡 Graphlit now supports content publishing, where documents, audio transcripts and even image descriptions, can be summarized, and repurposed into blog posts, emails or AI-generated podcasts.  With the new publishContents mutation, you can configure LLM prompts for summarization and publishing, and assign specifications to use different models and/or system prompts for each step in the process.  The published content will be reingested into Graphlit, and can be searched or used for conversations, like any other form of content.\n",
            "💡 Graphlit now supports publishing conversations as content with the new publishConversation mutation.  You can generate text or audio transcripts of your conversations, to be reused in other tools.\n",
            "💡 Graphlit now supports bulk summarization of contents with the summarizeContents mutation.  You can filter a set of content, by feed, by observable or by similar text, and run a set of summarizations across each content in parallel.\n",
            "💡 Graphlit now supports LLM entity extraction, with the new MODEL_TEXT entity extraction service type.  Similar to using Azure Cognitive Service Text Analytics, you can use any OpenAI or Anthropic model for extracting entities from text.  Internally the LLM returns JSON-LD entities, which we convert into Person, Organization, Place, etc. entities and assign observations to the extracted content.\n",
            "💡 Graphlit now supports LLM tools (aka function calls) with OpenAI models.  You can define the tools to be used with the LLM in the specification object.  With the new extractContents mutation, you can execute a prompt against content using a specification with tools defined.  The mutation will return the JSON arguments assigned by the LLM.\n",
            "💡 Graphlit now supports callback webhooks for LLM tools.  If you assign a URI in the ToolDefinition object, Graphlit will call your webhook the tool name and JSON arguments.  When you respond to the webhook with JSON, we will add that response to the LLM messages, and ask the LLM to complete the original prompt.\n",
            "💡 Graphlit now supports the selection of the Deepgram model (such as Meeting, Phonecall or Finance) with the preparation workflow.  Also, you can assign your own Deepgram API key, which will be used for audio transcription using that workflow.\n",
            "Added support for CLIP image embeddings using Roboflow, which can be used for similar image search.  If you search for contents by similar contents, we will now use the content's text and/or image embeddings to find similar content.\n",
            "Added support for dynamic web page ingestion.  Graphlit now navigates to and automatically scrolls web pages using Browserless.io, so we capture the fully rendered HTML before extracting text.  Also, we now support web page screenshots, if enabled with enableImageAnalysis property in preparation workflow.  These screenshots can be analyzed with multimodal modals, such as GPT-4 Vision, or can be used to create image embeddings for similar image search.\n",
            "Added table parsing when preparing documents.  We now store structured (tab-delimited) text in the JSON text mezzanine which is extracted from documents in the preparation workflow.\n",
            "Added reverse geocoding of lat/long locations found in image or other content metadata.  We now store the real-world address with the content metadata, for use in conversations.\n",
            "Added assistant messages to the conversation message history provided to the LLM.  Originally we had included only user messages, but now we are formatting both user and assistant messages into the LLM prompt for conversations.\n",
            "Added new chunking algorithm for text embeddings.  We support semantic chunking at the page or transcript segment level, and now will create embeddings from smaller sized text chunks per page or segment.\n",
            "Added content metadata to text and image embeddings.  To provide better context for the text embeddings, we now include formatted content metadata, which includes fields like title, subject, author, or description.  For emails, we include to, from, cc, and bcc fields.\n",
            "Added helper mutations isContentDone and isFeedDone which can be used for polling completion of ingested content, or all content ingested by a feed.\n",
            "Added richer image descriptions generated by the GPT-4 Vision model.  Now these provide more useful detail.\n",
            "Added validation of extracted hyperlinks.  Now we test the URIs and remove any inaccessible links during content enrichment.\n",
            "Added deleteContents,  deleteFeeds,  and deleteConversations mutations for multi-deletion of contents, feeds or conversations.\n",
            "Added deleteAllContents,  deleteAllFeeds,  and deleteAllConversations mutations for bulk, filtered deletion of entities.  You can delete all your contents, feeds, or conversations in your project, or a filtered subset of those entities.\n",
            "ℹ️ Starter tier now has a higher content limit of 100K content items.\n",
            "⚡ In the OpenAIImageExtractionProperties type, the detailMode field was renamed to detailLevel.\n",
