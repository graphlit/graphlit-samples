            "text/markdown": "[00:00:00] Hello, everyone, and welcome to this 2024\n\n[00:00:03] year in review for the Graphlet API based platform.\n\n[00:00:07] There has been incredible momentum all year with new SDKs,\n\n[00:00:12] model integrations,\n\n[00:00:14] and workflow improvements\n\n[00:00:15] designed to help you build smarter solutions faster.\n\n[00:00:19] Whether you're an engineer,\n\n[00:00:20] a product builder, or a technical\n\n[00:00:23] product manager,\n\n[00:00:25] these highlights should give you a clear picture of what's now possible with Graphlet.\n\n[00:00:30] Let's kick things off with January.\n\n[00:00:33] In mid January, on 18th,\n\n[00:00:36] Graphlet introduced brand new content publishing features.\n\n[00:00:40] These let you publish documents, audio transcripts,\n\n[00:00:43] and image descriptions straight from the platform.\n\n[00:00:46] And bulk summarization\n\n[00:00:48] meant you could quickly get top level takeaways across multiple files.\n\n[00:00:53] There was also new LLM entity extraction.\n\n[00:00:56] So if you needed to automatically identify organizations,\n\n[00:01:00] products, or other key data points, it became easier than ever.\n\n[00:01:05] A few days later, on January 22nd,\n\n[00:01:08] Graphlet added support for Google and Microsoft email feeds.\n\n[00:01:12] So you could ingest both past and new emails,\n\n[00:01:16] including attachments.\n\n[00:01:18] In place reingestion was also introduced,\n\n[00:01:22] letting developers reprocess content without having to create entirely new entries.\n\n[00:01:27] This is especially helpful when you realize there's more data you want to pull from an existing file.\n\n[00:01:33] Important bug fixes around link extraction in HTML\n\n[00:01:37] and shape text in PowerPoint were also tackled.\n\n[00:01:40] Then\n\n[00:01:41] in February, on 2nd, Graphlet rolled out semantic alerts,\n\n[00:01:45] which let you generate daily or routine reports on content changes,\n\n[00:01:50] new conversation summaries, or whatever else you wanted to keep an eye on.\n\n[00:01:54] That same release brought performance enhancements,\n\n[00:01:58] speeding up workflows for ingested content.\n\n[00:02:01] On February 21st, Graphlet expanded feed support further by adding OneDrive and Google Drive options,\n\n[00:02:07] including shared drives, which is a big deal for teams working across multiple cloud services.\n\n[00:02:13] Automatic extraction of embedded images from PDFs landed in the same update,\n\n[00:02:19] enabling richer content analysis for those who rely on PDF based assets.\n\n[00:02:24] A few bug fixes addressed PDF passing errors and conversation history issues,\n\n[00:02:29] ensuring more reliable experiences.\n\n[00:02:33] March was particularly active.\n\n[00:02:35] On March 10th, Graphlet debuts a command line interface,\n\n[00:02:39] letting developers quickly interact with the data API\n\n[00:02:42] from any terminal.\n\n[00:02:44] Claude 3, Mistral, and Grock models were added,\n\n[00:02:47] reflecting Graphlet's commitment to supporting multiple model providers.\n\n[00:02:52] The release also brought usage\n\n[00:02:54] and credits telemetry\n\n[00:02:56] so you could track how many tokens you're using or see which projects were using the most resources.\n\n[00:03:02] Then on March 13th, Graphlet announced support for Claude 3 haiku,\n\n[00:03:07] plus direct ingestion of base64\n\n[00:03:10] encoded files.\n\n[00:03:12] Right after that, on March 23rd,\n\n[00:03:15] came ingestion for popular issue tracking services.\n\n[00:03:19] Developers using linear\n\n[00:03:21] GitHub issues\n\n[00:03:22] or Jira could bring in tickets and sync them as searchable content.\n\n[00:03:28] You could also\n\n[00:03:29] ingest files using a web feed site map,\n\n[00:03:32] making big one shot ingestion tasks simpler.\n\n[00:03:36] Moving along to April, on April 7th, Graphlet added support for Discord feeds.\n\n[00:03:42] This meant you could pull in messages and attachments from Discord channels as easily as you might from Slack or other chat apps.\n\n[00:03:50] Cohere re ranking was also introduced,\n\n[00:03:53] allowing you to refine semantic search results in your retrieval augmented generation pipeline\n\n[00:03:58] for more accurate responses.\n\n[00:04:01] Section aware text chunking was a highlight too,\n\n[00:04:04] helping you create more meaningful chunks for better LLM interactions.\n\n[00:04:08] Then on April 23rd,\n\n[00:04:10] major developer focused updates arrived.\n\n[00:04:13] Native Python and Node. Js SDKs\n\n[00:04:17] with typed classes,\n\n[00:04:19] plus new OpenAI,\n\n[00:04:21] Cohere,\n\n[00:04:21] and Grok model support.\n\n[00:04:24] The GPT 4 surge\n\n[00:04:26] turbo\n\n[00:04:27] 128\n\n[00:04:28] k variant arrived here, offering a big context window for large queries and responses. Bug fixes in that release brand\n\n[00:04:33] new\n\n[00:04:35] features\n\n[00:04:37] included\n\n[00:04:38] Gina\n\n[00:04:40] and\n\n[00:04:42] Pongo\n\n[00:04:44] re rankers.\n\n[00:04:45] Brand new features included Gina and Pongo re rankers,\n\n[00:04:49] plus a Microsoft Teams feed for reading messages\n\n[00:04:52] from Teams channels.\n\n[00:04:54] Graphlet also improved error management\n\n[00:04:57] by handling URI validation failures more gracefully.\n\n[00:05:01] The May 15th release introduced graphRAG,\n\n[00:05:04] letting you pull extracted entities from your knowledge graph for use in LLM conversations.\n\n[00:05:10] This made conversation smarter\n\n[00:05:13] since the system could dynamically revise the AI's answer using structured data.\n\n[00:05:18] That same release offered open AI GPT 4 o for rag conversations\n\n[00:05:24] with better performance than earlier defaults.\n\n[00:05:28] June was a big month for advanced model support.\n\n[00:05:31] On June 9th, Graphlet announced integration\n\n[00:05:34] with deep seek l l m's and automatic JSON LD passing from web pages,\n\n[00:05:40] a handy feature if you're analyzing structured data embedded in HTML.\n\n[00:05:45] This release also improved knowledge,\n\n[00:05:48] right, graph performance\n\n[00:05:50] by parallelizing retrieval tasks.\n\n[00:05:53] Then on June 21st, developers gained access to the anthropic Claude 3.5\n\n[00:05:58] SONNET model and knowledge graph semantic search for entities like person or organization.\n\n[00:06:05] This meant you could do more advanced queries and store richer metadata for accurate entity searching.\n\n[00:06:11] July was jam packed.\n\n[00:06:13] Kicking off on July 4th, Graphlet introduced webhook alerts\n\n[00:06:17] so you could receive HTTP\n\n[00:06:19] post notifications\n\n[00:06:21] anytime certain conditions were met,\n\n[00:06:24] like a newly ingested file\n\n[00:06:26] or a specific entity type appearing.\n\n[00:06:29] DeepSeek's 128 k token context window was also unveiled,\n\n[00:06:34] letting you feed extra large contexts into queries.\n\n[00:06:39] On July 15th,\n\n[00:06:41] SharePoint feed support arrived,\n\n[00:06:44] plus conversation features like time stamps and more flexible search configurations.\n\n[00:06:49] Then on July 19th, we got support for OpenAI's\n\n[00:06:53] GPT 4 o Mini,\n\n[00:06:55] a more lightweight variant with 16 k output tokens.\n\n[00:07:00] That release included a bring your own key feature for Azure AI document intelligence\n\n[00:07:05] so you could manage your own billing.\n\n[00:07:08] On July 25th,\n\n[00:07:10] Graphlet added Mistral Large 2 and Nemo,\n\n[00:07:13] as well as expanded llama 3.1\n\n[00:07:16] models for Grok,\n\n[00:07:17] a great boost for developers in need of large scale language capabilities.\n\n[00:07:23] And on July 28th, an indexing workflow stage was introduced for advanced language detection.\n\n[00:07:29] This made it possible to detect text languages\n\n[00:07:32] automatically\n\n[00:07:33] and tag content accordingly.\n\n[00:07:36] In August, on 3rd, a new data model for observations\n\n[00:07:40] provided more structured ways to store and link text occurrences,\n\n[00:07:45] images,\n\n[00:07:45] or time stamps to your content.\n\n[00:07:48] On August 8th, Graflett released LLM based document preparation,\n\n[00:07:53] an open source dot net SDK,\n\n[00:07:56] and support for Claude 3 Vision Models for image based entity analysis.\n\n[00:08:02] By August 11th, Azure AI Document Intelligence had become the default for document preparation,\n\n[00:08:08] improving table extraction in PDFs,\n\n[00:08:11] Word docs, and more, albeit at a slightly higher credit usage.\n\n[00:08:16] Then on August 20th, Graphlet tackled medical centric use cases.\n\n[00:08:21] Medical related entities like drug names, guidelines,\n\n[00:08:24] or conditions were enriched\n\n[00:08:26] so teams building health care apps or research tools could map content more precisely.\n\n[00:08:32] September opened with a release on the first,\n\n[00:08:35] introducing far enrichment for medical data\n\n[00:08:38] and new Cohere model updates.\n\n[00:08:41] On September 3rd, Graphlet launched web search feeds with Tivili\n\n[00:08:46] or Exa dotai,\n\n[00:08:47] letting you ingest public web data for further analysis.\n\n[00:08:51] September 20th was quite significant as well, marking the official introduction of paid subscriptions,\n\n[00:08:58] hobby, starter, and growth.\n\n[00:09:01] That provided clearer usage limits for different project sizes.\n\n[00:09:06] Users also got better semantic search with improved relevance.\n\n[00:09:11] A few days later, on September 26th, Graphlet announced model expansions for Google AI, Sarah Brass, and the newest Grok Llama 3.2 preview sets, plus updates to help custom instructions flow more smoothly into extraction prompts.\n\n[00:09:27] Finally, on September 30th, Azure AI model inference was introduced,\n\n[00:09:31] meaning you could host models like MetaLama\n\n[00:09:35] 3.2\n\n[00:09:35] on a serverless Azure environment for easier scaling.\n\n[00:09:39] Then came October.\n\n[00:09:41] On October 3rd, Graphlet extended tool calling to multiple model providers,\n\n[00:09:46] including OpenAI,\n\n[00:09:48] Mistral, DeepSeek, Grok, and Cerebras.\n\n[00:09:52] The new ingest batch mutation\n\n[00:09:54] let you send in arrays of URIs\n\n[00:09:57] asynchronously,\n\n[00:09:58] ideal for large scale ingestion projects.\n\n[00:10:02] On October 7th, the platform added official support for Anthropic and Gemini tool calling,\n\n[00:10:07] giving you more ways to connect AI logic with external data or services.\n\n[00:10:13] October 9th introduced GitHub repository feeds so you could ingest code files automatically,\n\n[00:10:20] An excellent feature for developer documentation or release notes.\n\n[00:10:24] Later in the month, on October 21st, Graphlet began supporting a wide range of embedding models from OpenAI,\n\n[00:10:31] Cohere, Gina, Mistral, Voyage, and Google AI.\n\n[00:10:36] On October 22nd,\n\n[00:10:37] the Anthropic Sonnet 3 0.5 model arrived,\n\n[00:10:41] plus Cohere image embeddings,\n\n[00:10:43] letting you handle visual content more efficiently.\n\n[00:10:46] And on October 30, well, Graphlet brought in simulated tool calling for certain LLMs,\n\n[00:10:51] offering a more flexible approach to orchestrating calls without leaving the platform.\n\n[00:10:56] Moving on to November, on November 4th, Graphlet released the anthropic Claude 3.5 haiku model,\n\n[00:11:03] plus a new feature that automatically\n\n[00:11:05] disables feeds after the free tier quota is reached.\n\n[00:11:09] Then on November 10th, multi turn content summarization was unveiled,\n\n[00:11:14] and a web search feature allowed you to search the Internet for additional context.\n\n[00:11:19] November 16th specifically added multi turn text summarization.\n\n[00:11:24] And November 24th introduced multi turn image analysis,\n\n[00:11:29] letting you revise images or image descriptions across steps in a conversation.\n\n[00:11:34] These capabilities\n\n[00:11:36] let teams handle dynamic visual data\n\n[00:11:39] in ways that go beyond a single prompt and response flow.\n\n[00:11:43] Finally, December capped off the year with 3 notable updates.\n\n[00:11:47] On December 1st, Graphlet added support for retrieval only rag workflows.\n\n[00:11:52] This helps those who want to format LLM prompts and retrieve relevant data\n\n[00:11:57] without having the model generate final answers.\n\n[00:12:00] Then on December 9th, the platform introduced website mapping,\n\n[00:12:05] screenshot generation,\n\n[00:12:07] and summarization\n\n[00:12:08] or text extraction in one go,\n\n[00:12:11] plus a new Grop Llama model.\n\n[00:12:14] And wrapping things up on December 22nd,\n\n[00:12:17] Graphlet announced new feeds for Dropbox,\n\n[00:12:20] Box, Intercom, and Zendesk.\n\n[00:12:23] They also integrated the latest OpenAI\n\n[00:12:26] o 1 and Gemini Flash 2 point o experimental models.\n\n[00:12:31] This last release of the year included numerous smaller improvements,\n\n[00:12:35] like flexible filtering on observables\n\n[00:12:38] and bug\n\n[00:12:39] fixes that made ingestion from various cloud and web sources even more robust.\n\n[00:12:45] Throughout 24, bug fixes addressed everything from misconfigured feeds to partial PDF extractions.\n\n[00:12:52] The team worked hard to ensure conversations remain stable,\n\n[00:12:56] especially\n\n[00:12:57] with large or unusual datasets.\n\n[00:13:00] Model updates also kept pace with new releases\n\n[00:13:03] from OpenAI,\n\n[00:13:05]
