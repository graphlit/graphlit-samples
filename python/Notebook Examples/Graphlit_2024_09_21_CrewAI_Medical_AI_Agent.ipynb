Therapy includes pre- vention of thromboembolic events and controlling symptoms. Traditional stroke risk scoring systems used in the general population are not predictive in patients with HCM. Vitamin K antagonists are effective for stroke pre- vention, and recent studies support the use of DOACs as well.1-5 Asymptomatic AF detected by cardiac devices or monitors also increases risk of stroke, so the decision to anticoagulate should take into consideration the duration of episodes as well as underlying risk factors. When a rhythm-control strategy is needed, several antiar- rhythmic drugs have been shown to be safe and effective, allowing for individualization according to underlying substrate and patient preference. Catheter ablation is also an option, although the procedure is less effective than in the general population, and there is a more frequent need of repeat procedures and concomitant use of antiar- rhythmic drugs. Surgical AF ablation is a potential rhythm management option in patients undergoing surgical myectomy. Other supraventricular arrhythmias and atrial flutter are likely not increased in incidence in patients with HCM, and treatment is usually similar to populations without HCM."

            "text/markdown": "Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Clinical AF is AF that causes symptoms for which pa- tients seek medical attention. Although no RCTs have been published, the risk of systemic embolization is high in patients with HCM with AF. A meta-analysis that included 33 studies and 7381 patients revealed an overall prevalence of thromboembolism in patients with HCM with AF of 27.09% and incidence of 3.75 per 10 patients.1 The stroke risk is independent of CHA2DS2-VASc score,3º with a significant number of strokes observed in patients with a score of 0. Several studies have shown that anticoagulation, particularly warfarin with target international normalized ratio 2 to 3, reduces the stroke risk in this population,2,30 whereas other publications have shown DOACs to be at least as effective as warfarin, with additional ad- vantages reported, such as improved patient satisfac- tion and long-term outcomes.3-5 Although left atrial appendage occlusion devices have been evaluated in populations, the number of patients with HCM in these trials was limited. Thus, the role of left atrial appendage occlusion devices in HCM remains un- tested. The recommendations for anticoagulation of patients with atrial flutter are the same as those for patients with AF.14\n2. Similar to patients without HCM, asymptomatic or subclinical AF (SCAF) is detected by cardiac devices in\npatients with HCM as well. SCAF was reported in 16 of 30 patients with HCM (53%) after a median follow-up of 595 days.7 Device-detected AF was identified in 29 of 114 patients with HCM (25%), resulting in an annual- ized incidence of 4% per year.6 In patients without HCM, SCAF has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, albeit lower than the risk described for clinical AF.8 Considerable debate exists regarding the AF duration threshold for initiating anticoagulation in SCAF because the duration used to define and quantify AF varied significantly between different studies. Nevertheless, the data increasingly show that longer duration episodes are associated with greatest risk. One study suggested only episodes >24 hours were associated with increased risk.15 Also influencing risk are the total AF burden11 and the presence of traditional risk factors, whereas very short episodes lasting a few seconds do not appear to in- crease risk.16,17 When making the diagnosis of device- detected AF, review of stored intracardiac ECGs is essential to exclude artifact or false-positives.\n3. Given the poor tolerance of AF in patients with HCM, a rhythm-control strategy is often preferred, because data support improved outcomes with a rhythm- control strategy compared with historical controls.9,10 For those patients for whom a rate-control strategy is chosen (eg, because of patient choice, antiarrhythmic drug failure, or intolerance), a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or a combi- nation of the 2 is preferable. A theoretical concern ex- ists that digoxin could exacerbate LVOTO attributable to a positive inotropic effect. However, in the absence of a gradient, digoxin is a potential option, although data on efficacy in this population are lacking. Medi- cation choice should be individually determined ac- cording to age, underlying substrate, comorbidities, and severity of symptoms. Dose adjustments are based on the balance between adequate rate control versus adverse effects, including excessive bradycardia. In patients with hypotension, dyspnea at rest, and very high resting gradients (eg, >100 mm Hg), verapamil should be avoided. Atrioventricular node ablation with pacemaker implantation can be a last option in re- fractory cases.\n4. SCAF is often observed in patients with HCM and implanted cardiac devices6,7 and has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism.8 Yet, the minimum duration of SCAF that confers increased risk has not been precisely defined, because a gradient of risk appears to be evident depending on underlying substrate. Although ASSERT (Asymptomatic Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Evaluation in Pacemaker Pa- tients and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pac- ing Trial) data suggested only episodes >24 hours\n| TABLE 9 Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy Options for Patients With HCM and AF |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Antiarrhythmic Drug | Efficacy for AF | Adverse Effects | Toxicities | Use in HCM |\n| Disopyramide | Modest | Anticholinergic HF | Prolonged QTc TdP | Particularly with early onset AF Generally used in conjunction with atrioventricular nodal blocking agents |\n| Flecainide and propafenone | ... | Prolonged QRS | Proarrhythmia Typical atrial flutter | Not generally recommended in the absence of an ICD |\n| Sotalol | Modest | Fatigue Bradycardia | Prolonged QTc TdP | Reasonable |\n| Dofetilide | Modest | Headache | Prolonged QTc TdP | Reasonable |\n| Dronedarone | Low | HF | Prolonged QTc | ... |\n| Amiodarone | Modest-high | Bradycardia | Liver, lung, thyroid, skin, neurologic Prolonged QTc | Reasonable |\n\nAF indicates atrial fibrillation; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; HF, heart failure; ICD, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; and TdP, torsades de pointes.\nincreased stroke risk,15 other evidence suggests that shorter duration episodes may pose a risk in patients with traditional risks factors.16 In ASSERT, the absolute stroke risk increased with increasing CHADS2 score, reaching a rate of 3.78 per year in those with score >2.18 Another group stratified risk according to AF duration and CHADS2 score, with a CHADS2 score of 1 increasing the risk only if AF duration was >24 hours, whereas for CHADS2 scores ≥2, episodes >5 minutes increased risk.19 Similar risk stratification is unavailable in HCM, yet risk factors for stroke in the population with HCM have been identified and include advancing age, pre- vious embolic events, NYHA functional class, left atrial diameter, vascular disease, and maximal LV wall thickness.3º When very short AF duration is observed, continued surveillance should be maintained as the burden of AF is likely to progress.\n5. Studies suggest that with current therapies, AF in pa- tients with HCM can be managed effectively, leading to low morbidity and mortality compared with historical controls.9,10 In general, drug selection for rhythm control in patients with HCM is based on extrapolation from studies of the AF population at large. Yet, reports suggest several drugs are safe and effective in patients with HCM (Table 9). Amiodarone has been used over many years and is generally deemed a favored op- tion.10,20 Disopyramide has been safely prescribed for reduction of LVOTO, but its efficacy in AF is not well established.21,22 Data on NYHA functional class IC antiarrhythmic agents are limited because of concerns regarding their use in patients with structural heart disease. When used, therapy with NYHA functional class IC agents is safest in the presence of an ICD.10 NYHA functional class III agents have been used as well; a report in 25 patients with HCM showed dofeti- lide to be well tolerated and facilitated AF manage- ment.13 Sotalol has also been shown to be safe and is commonly used in pediatric patients as well, either in\noral or intravenous forms.23,24,31,32 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated safety precautions should be adopted when prescribing antiarrhythmic drugs.\n6. Catheter ablation plays an important role in the man- agement of AF in HCM. Although no RCTs exist in this area, several meta-analyses have been published in patients with HCM undergoing catheter ablation for drug refractory AF, including one that compared catheter ablation between patients with HCM versus a cohort without HCM.12,25 In general, the procedure is safe and remains an important tool. However, the re- sults seem less favorable compared with patients without HCM, with a 2-fold higher risk of relapse, more frequent need of repeat procedures, and higher use of concomitant antiarrhythmic drugs. This is attributed to the fact that patients with HCM have a greater degree of electrophysiologic and structural remodeling than the population without HCM.25 Contributing factors for atrial remodeling include LVOTO, diastolic impair- ment, MR, and other factors. It can be postulated that aggressive intervention in the earlier stages of disease would be more effective, but this is unproven, and ongoing remodeling is expected. Some authors have suggested the need for a more extensive ablation approach, with linear lesions and ablation of triggers not associated with the pulmonary veins often required to improve the long-term durability of the procedure.26\n7. AF in patients with HCM is often poorly tolerated; therefore, aggressive rhythm-control strategies are sometimes required. Because of the lower success rate of catheter ablation in patients with HCM compared with the general AF population, surgical AF ablation is a potential rhythm management option, especially in patients already undergoing open heart surgery for a surgical myectomy. In combination with surgical relief of the LVOT gradient and MR, which can limit or even\nreverse negative atrial remodeling, concomitant sur- gical AF ablation may be successful in decreasing AF burden. Several studies have reported satisfactory midterm efficacy, yet these reports universally include a small number of patients, and the durability of the procedure appears to decrease with time.27,29 In a study that represents the largest series of patients with AF treated surgically, freedom from AF recurrence at 1 year was 44% for ablation patients (n = 49) and 75%\nwith the maze procedure (n = 72) (P<0.001).1º In this study, with concomitant surgical ablation, freedom from AF at 3 years was 70%, with left atrial size being a predictor of recurrence.1º"

Catheter ablation of the CTI is useful in patients with atrial flutter that is either symptomatic or refractory to pharmacological rate control (243,372-375). |\n| See Online Data 16 | Supplements and 17. | Rate control can be difficult to achieve in atrial flutter, and a rhythm control strategy is often chosen. Catheter ablation of CTI-dependent atrial flutter is often preferred to long-term pharmacological therapy; in this rhythm, the CTI represents the optimal target for ablation because a line of ablation between the tricuspid valve annulus and inferior vena cava can effectively interrupt the circuit. A variety of techniques are applicable, including various catheter types, energy delivery systems, and mapping and visualization tools; generally, success depends on creation of a complete line of block and permanent interruption of conduction across the CTI (Table 8). Successful ablation is often heralded by intraprocedural interruption of the arrhythmia and subsequent EP demonstration of bidirectional block across the ablated tissue. |\n| I | C-LD | 2. Beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful to control the ventricular rate in patients with hemodynamically tolerated atrial flutter (347-349). |\n| See Online Data 16 | and 17. Supplements | In some circumstances of persistent atrial flutter or in patients who have infrequent reasonably well-tolerated episodes of atrial flutter, a rate-control strategy may be chosen. In atrial flutter, the relatively slower atrial rate compared with AF often paradoxically results in more rapid AV nodal conduction because there is less concealed AV nodal conduction. Therefore, achieving adequate rate control can be difficult. Higher doses of beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil, and often a combination of agents, may be needed to achieve adequate rate control. Beta blockers are generally preferred in patients with heart failure. Avoidance of beta blockers, diltiazem, and verapamil in patients with pre-excited atrial flutter is recommended, given the potential for accelerated ventricular rates degenerating to ventricular fibrillation, as has been reported to occur rarely in similar patients with AF (274). |\n| I | C-LD | 3. Catheter ablation is useful in patients with recurrent symptomatic non-CTI-dependent flutter after failure of at least 1 antiarrhythmic agent (134,327). |\n| See Online Data 16 | and 17. Supplements | No prospective RCTs have compared the efficacy or safety of antiarrhythmic drugs with that of catheter ablation for non-CTI-dependent atrial flutter. In general, catheter ablation of non-CTI-dependent atrial flutter is substantially more difficult than ablation of CTI-dependent flutter because the anatomic circuits are complex, are often not anatomically defined, and can be difficult to locate. Knowledge of the prior surgical or ablation approach and detailed activation and entrainment mapping of the tachycardia are useful during attempts at ablation (Table 8). The location of the circuit determines ablation approach and risks. Observational data support the relative effectiveness and safety of catheter ablation in experienced centers (134,327). Many of the atrial flutters that are observed during the first 3 months after catheter ablation or cardiac surgery will not persist beyond the periprocedural period, so attempts at ablation can be deferred unless pharmacological therapy and/or cardioversion are unsuccessful (327). |\n| I | B-NR | 4. Ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF (365). |\n| See Online Data 16 | Supplements and 17. | The risk of stroke associated with AF is well established, and several RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of anticoagulation for stroke prevention in patients with additional risk factors (366). Anticoagulation has also been shown to prevent stroke when administered during the weeks immediately before and after cardioversion (367). Whether atrial flutter carries a risk of stroke similar to that in patients with AF has been debated in the past but is now supported by limited evidence from mechanistic, observational, and prospective studies that include patients primarily with atrial flutter (365-369). Several reports have suggested that the risk of stroke in patients with atrial flutter is mitigated by anticoagulation. Meta-analysis of 13 studies of patients undergoing cardioversion of atrial flutter reported short-term stroke risks ranging from 0% to 7%, and the thromboembolism rate in patients with sustained flutter in 4 studies averaged 3% annually (365). Other studies have reported similar risk and effectiveness of anticoagulation (369). Therefore, on the basis of available data, recommendations for antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial flutter are similar to those for patients with AF (10). |\n\nIIa\nB-R\n1. The following drugs can be useful to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with symptomatic, recurrent atrial flutter, with the drug choice depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities:\na. Amiodarone (376)\nb. Dofetilide (346,377)\nc. Sotalol (378)\nSee Online Data Supplements 16 and 17.\nIn patients in whom ablation is not being considered because of contraindications (such as underlying medical illness) or because of patient preference, a variety of antiarrhythmic drugs are available. These drugs act by suppressing triggers and altering atrial tissue refractoriness. Individual properties of each drug need to be considered for proper use. Much of the data pertaining to use of amiodarone in management of atrial arrhythmias has been derived from use in patients with AF(10). Few data are available for patients with atrial flutter. Amiodarone has significant toxicities, so it is used only when other treatments are contraindicated or ineffective. Nevertheless, administration is reasonable, particularly in patients with heart failure or significant underlying heart disease (376).\nDofetilide may be more effective than many other drugs but must be started in an inpatient setting (346,377). The dose is adjusted on the basis of renal function, with close monitoring of the Q-T interval and subsequent monitoring for altered renal function.\nSotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic, is generally well tolerated but is associated with typical beta blocker side effects, such as fatigue and bradycardia (378). The major potential cardiac toxicity for both drugs is torsades de pointes.\nIIa\nB-NR\n2. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF (317,379-381).\nSee Online Data Supplements 16 and 17.\nSome patients with AF treated with propafenone, flecainide, or amiodarone will develop atrial flutter. In this circumstance, if flutter becomes the dominant arrhythmia, ablation of the CTI and continued use of the antiarrhythmic drug can decrease the incidence of atrial flutter and facilitate the pharmacological management of AF (379,380).\nIIa\nC-LD\n3. Catheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter (381,382).\nSee Online Data Supplements 16 and 17.\nThe indications for catheter ablation of AF are discussed in the 2014 AF guideline (10). When AF and atrial flutter coexist, 1 randomized study demonstrated that at 1-year follow-up, greater success in terms of arrhythmia suppression and quality-of-life score resulted from AF ablation (with or without atrial flutter ablation) than from atrial flutter ablation alone (381). It may be that AF ablation alone is sufficient to control both arrhythmias, although CTI ablation reduced the early postablation arrhythmia recurrence rate (382).\nIIa\nC-LD\n4. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non-CTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options (135).\nSee Online Data Supplement 17.\nNo prospective RCTs have compared the efficacy or safety of antiarrhythmic drugs with that of catheter ablation for non-CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Observational data, however, support the relative effectiveness and safety of catheter ablation in experienced centers (135,327). Many of the atrial flutters that are observed during the first 3 months after ablation or cardiac surgery will not persist beyond the periprocedural period, so attempts at ablation can be deferred unless attempts at pharmacological therapy or cardioversion are unsuccessful (135).\nIIb\nB-R\n1. Flecainide or propafenone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic recurrent atrial flutter (383-385).\nSee Online Data Supplements 16 and 17.\nData to support the recommendation for flecainide and propafenone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter is derived from trials that pooled patients with AF and atrial flutter, with the vast majority of the patients having AF. It is therefore possible that these agents are not as effective for treating isolated atrial flutter as they are for AF (386). Flecainide and propafenone may result in slowing of the atrial flutter cycle length, which may lead to a rapid 1:1 ventricular response (387). Because of this, caution is advised with flecainide and propafenone in patients with atrial flutter at risk of 1:1 conduction. The risk may be reduced by coadministration of medications that slow AV nodal conduction, such as beta blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem.\n| IIb C-LD | 2. Catheter ablation may be reasonable for asymptomatic patients with recurrent atrial flutter (102,121,372). |\n| See Online Data Supplements 16 and 17. | Catheter ablation of atrial flutter is highly effective, with single-procedure success rates >90% (102) and an excellent safety profile (102,121). In patients with recurrent atrial flutter, long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm is more likely with ablation than with pharmacological therapy (372). Also, ablation may avoid potential development of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy. |\n"

            "Managing atrial fibrillation (AF), which is an irregular heartbeat, involves several treatment options to help you feel better and reduce your risk of complications, especially if you also have peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Here’s what you need to know about the choices available for managing AF:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Catheter Ablation**:\n",
            "   - **What is it?** Catheter ablation is a procedure where doctors use thin, flexible tubes (catheters) to destroy specific areas of the heart that are causing irregular rhythms. \n",
            "   - **Who is it for?** This option is suggested for people with symptoms from their AF who haven’t done well with heart rhythm medications. It’s particularly good for:\n",
            "     - Those who have episodes of AF that come and go (called paroxysmal AF).\n",
            "     - People who have persistent AF and continue to have symptoms despite taking medication as directed.\n",
            "   - **What are the goals?** The main goals of this procedure are to restore a normal heart rhythm (called sinus rhythm), reduce symptoms (like feeling your heart racing or out of breath), and improve your overall quality of life.\n",
            "   - **Important note:** It's crucial to have this procedure done by experienced doctors in reputable heart centers to ensure better results.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Stroke Risk Reduction**:\n",
            "   - **Why is it important?** Having AF increases the risk of blood clots and strokes, especially in people with PAD. Therefore, taking steps to reduce this risk is vital.\n",
            "   - **What can help?** \n",
            "     - **Antiplatelet therapy:** You might be advised to take medicines like aspirin or clopidogrel, which help prevent blood clots.\n",
            "     - **Anticoagulant therapy:** In some high-risk cases, like if you have other significant health problems, your doctor might recommend anticoagulants (blood thinners) to further decrease your stroke risk. This is often based on scores like the CHA2DS2-VASc, which assess your overall risk.\n",
            "   - **Managing other health issues:** It's important to keep other health conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes under control. Managing these effectively can also help lower your risk of strokes and other cardiovascular problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, there are effective treatment options for managing atrial fibrillation, especially for those with peripheral arterial disease. Whether it’s considering catheter ablation to restore a normal heartbeat or taking medications to prevent strokes, you and your healthcare team can work together to find the right strategy for you. The goal is to help you live a healthier, more comfortable life while minimizing the risks associated with atrial fibrillation.\u001b[00m\n",
