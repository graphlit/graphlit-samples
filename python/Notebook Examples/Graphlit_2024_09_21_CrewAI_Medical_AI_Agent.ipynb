The efficacy of long-term warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF is well established; ran- domized trials have shown reduced embolic rates and mortality. The AHA/ACC/Heart Rhythm Society guide- lines for AF recommend use of the CHA2DS2-VASc score (history of hypertension, age ≥75 [doubled weight], diabetes mellitus, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [doubled weight], vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, sex category) to assess patient risk for adverse outcomes before initiating anticoagulation therapy (1,27,28). Regardless of whether patients receive rhythm or rate control, anticoagulation is recommended for patients with HF and AF for stroke prevention with a CHA2DS2- VASc score of ≥2 (for men) and ≥3 (for women) (2-5).\n2. Trials of DOAC have compared the efficacy and safety with warfarin therapy rather than placebo. Several DOAC are available, including the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran (2-5). These drugs do not need routine anticoagulation monitoring or dose adjustment. The fixed dosing together with fewer in- teractions may simplify patient management, particu- larly with the polypharmacy commonly seen in HF, but cost for some patients can be prohibitive when not covered by insurance. These drugs have a potential for an improved benefit-risk profile compared with warfarin, which may increase their use in practice, especially in those at increased bleeding risk (6-9). In a meta-analysis of 4 trials examining efficacy and safety of DOAC in patients with and without HF, DOAC more effectively reduced the rate of stroke or systemic em- bolism, major bleeding, and intracranial bleeding compared with warfarin, with no treatment heteroge- neity by HF status (10).\n3. The 2 largest RCTs of AF ablation in HF showed a benefit in hospitalizations and mortality with ablation (11,12) although other smaller trials did not. In the AATAC (Ablation Versus Amiodarone for Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Conges- tive Heart Failure and an Implanted Device) trial, 203 patients with persistent AF, LVEF <40%, and NYHA class II to III HF, ablation improved the likelihood of maintaining normal sinus rhythm at 24 months compared with amiodarone and, in addition, had a 45% decrease in hospitalization and decrease in mortality (8% vs. 18%) (11). The CASTLE AF (Catheter Ablation\nfor Atrial Fibrillation with Heart Failure) trial ran- domized 363 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, LVEF <35%, NYHA class II to IV HF, and ICD to ablation versus standard medical care (12). The com- posite endpoint of death or rehospitalization was lower in ablation (28.5%) compared with standard care (44.6%). In addition, there was a lower mortality in the ablation group. In a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs comparing rhythm versus rate control, patients un- dergoing catheter ablation had improved survival (49% relative risk reduction) and reduced hospitalizations (56% relative risk reduction) (13).\n4. If a rhythm control strategy fails or is undesired, and ventricular rates remain rapid despite medical therapy after all other options are exhausted, atrioventricular nodal ablation with implantation of a CRT device can be considered as a treatment option. Ablate and pace is an old strategy for difficult to rate control AF. Early studies with RV pacing showed benefit (15,16). How- ever, when RV pacing was compared with cardiac resynchronization in more recent trials, especially in those with reduced LVEFs, CRT generally produced more benefit than RV pacing (17-21). The PAVE (Left Ventricular-Based Cardiac Stimulation post AV Nodal Ablation Evaluation) and the BLOCK-HF (Biventricular versus Right Ventricular Pacing in Patients with AV block) trials included patients with LVEF >35%, with mean EF 46% (22) in PAVE and 40% in BLOCK-HF (enrolled ≤ 50%). In both of these trials, patients un- dergoing CRT had improved outcomes.\n5. HF is a hypercoagulable state and serves as an inde- pendent risk factor for stroke, systemic embolism, and mortality in the setting of AF (23,24). There are compelling data to support the use of anticoagulation in most patients with HF and concomitant AF, barring contraindications. In patients with HF and a CHA2DS2- VASc score of 1, those with AF had a 3-fold higher risk compared with individuals without concomitant AF (25). In a post hoc analysis of 2 contemporary HF trials, paroxysmal and new onset AF were associated with a greater risk for hospitalization caused by HF or stroke (26). In a recent registry study, the risk of stroke was particularly higher in the initial period after diagnosis of HF among patients with prevalent AF (29). Because HF is a risk factor, additional risk factors may not be required to support the use of anticoagulation in pa- tients with HF, and the decision to anticoagulate can be individualized according to risk versus benefit."

            "text/markdown": "Recommendation-Specific Supportive Text\n1. Clinical AF is AF that causes symptoms for which pa- tients seek medical attention. Although no RCTs have been published, the risk of systemic embolization is high in patients with HCM with AF. A meta-analysis that included 33 studies and 7381 patients revealed an overall prevalence of thromboembolism in patients with HCM with AF of 27.09% and incidence of 3.75 per 10 patients.1 The stroke risk is independent of CHA2DS2-VASc score,30 with a significant number of strokes observed in patients with a score of 0. Several studies have shown that anticoagulation, particularly warfarin with target international normalized ratio 2 to 3, reduces the stroke risk in this population,2,30 whereas other publications have shown DOACs to be at least as effective as warfarin, with additional ad- vantages reported, such as improved patient satisfac- tion and long-term outcomes.3-5 Although left atrial appendage occlusion devices have been evaluated in populations, the number of patients with HCM in these trials was limited. Thus, the role of left atrial appendage occlusion devices in HCM remains un- tested. The recommendations for anticoagulation of patients with atrial flutter are the same as those for patients with AF.14\n2. Similar to patients without HCM, asymptomatic or subclinical AF (SCAF) is detected by cardiac devices in\npatients with HCM as well. SCAF was reported in 16 of 30 patients with HCM (53%) after a median follow-up of 595 days.7 Device-detected AF was identified in 29 of 114 patients with HCM (25%), resulting in an annual- ized incidence of 4% per year.6 In patients without HCM, SCAF has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, albeit lower than the risk described for clinical AF.8 Considerable debate exists regarding the AF duration threshold for initiating anticoagulation in SCAF because the duration used to define and quantify AF varied significantly between different studies. Nevertheless, the data increasingly show that longer duration episodes are associated with greatest risk. One study suggested only episodes >24 hours were associated with increased risk.15 Also influencing risk are the total AF burden11 and the presence of traditional risk factors, whereas very short episodes lasting a few seconds do not appear to in- crease risk.16,17 When making the diagnosis of device- detected AF, review of stored intracardiac ECGs is essential to exclude artifact or false-positives.\n3. Given the poor tolerance of AF in patients with HCM, a rhythm-control strategy is often preferred, because data support improved outcomes with a rhythm- control strategy compared with historical controls.9,10 For those patients for whom a rate-control strategy is chosen (eg, because of patient choice, antiarrhythmic drug failure, or intolerance), a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, a beta blocker, or a combi- nation of the 2 is preferable. A theoretical concern ex- ists that digoxin could exacerbate LVOTO attributable to a positive inotropic effect. However, in the absence of a gradient, digoxin is a potential option, although data on efficacy in this population are lacking. Medi- cation choice should be individually determined ac- cording to age, underlying substrate, comorbidities, and severity of symptoms. Dose adjustments are based on the balance between adequate rate control versus adverse effects, including excessive bradycardia. In patients with hypotension, dyspnea at rest, and very high resting gradients (eg, >100 mm Hg), verapamil should be avoided. Atrioventricular node ablation with pacemaker implantation can be a last option in re- fractory cases.\n4. SCAF is often observed in patients with HCM and implanted cardiac devices6,7 and has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism.8 Yet, the minimum duration of SCAF that confers increased risk has not been precisely defined, because a gradient of risk appears to be evident depending on underlying substrate. Although ASSERT (Asymptomatic Atrial Fibrillation and Stroke Evaluation in Pacemaker Pa- tients and the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pac- ing Trial) data suggested only episodes >24 hours\nTABLE 9 Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy Options for Patients With HCM and AF\nTABLE 9 Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy Options for Patients With HCM and AF\n| Antiarrhythmic Drug | Efficacy for AF | Adverse Effects | Toxicities | Use in HCM |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Disopyramide | Modest | Anticholinergic HF | Prolonged QTc TdP | Particularly with early onset AF Generally used in conjunction with atrioventricular nodal blocking agents |\n| Flecainide and propafenone | ... | Prolonged QRS | Proarrhythmia Typical atrial flutter | Not generally recommended in the absence of an ICD |\n| Sotalol | Modest | Fatigue Bradycardia | Prolonged QTc TdP | Reasonable |\n| Dofetilide | Modest | Headache | Prolonged QTc TdP | Reasonable |\n| Dronedarone | Low | HF | Prolonged QTc | ... |\n| Amiodarone | Modest-high | Bradycardia | Liver, lung, thyroid, skin, neurologic Prolonged QTc | Reasonable |\n\nAF indicates atrial fibrillation; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; HF, heart failure; ICD, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator; and TdP, torsades de pointes.\nincreased stroke risk,15 other evidence suggests that shorter duration episodes may pose a risk in patients with traditional risks factors.16 In ASSERT, the absolute stroke risk increased with increasing CHADS2 score, reaching a rate of 3.78 per year in those with score >2.18 Another group stratified risk according to AF duration and CHADS2 score, with a CHADS2 score of 1 increasing the risk only if AF duration was >24 hours, whereas for CHADS2 scores ≥2, episodes >5 minutes increased risk.19 Similar risk stratification is unavailable in HCM, yet risk factors for stroke in the population with HCM have been identified and include advancing age, pre- vious embolic events, NYHA functional class, left atrial diameter, vascular disease, and maximal LV wall thickness.3º When very short AF duration is observed, continued surveillance should be maintained as the burden of AF is likely to progress.\n5. Studies suggest that with current therapies, AF in pa- tients with HCM can be managed effectively, leading to low morbidity and mortality compared with historical controls.9,10 In general, drug selection for rhythm control in patients with HCM is based on extrapolation from studies of the AF population at large. Yet, reports suggest several drugs are safe and effective in patients with HCM (Table 9). Amiodarone has been used over many years and is generally deemed a favored op- tion.10,20 Disopyramide has been safely prescribed for reduction of LVOTO, but its efficacy in AF is not well established.21,22 Data on NYHA functional class IC antiarrhythmic agents are limited because of concerns regarding their use in patients with structural heart disease. When used, therapy with NYHA functional class IC agents is safest in the presence of an ICD.10 NYHA functional class III agents have been used as well; a report in 25 patients with HCM showed dofeti- lide to be well tolerated and facilitated AF manage- ment.13 Sotalol has also been shown to be safe and is commonly used in pediatric patients as well, either in\noral or intravenous forms.23,24,31,32 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated safety precautions should be adopted when prescribing antiarrhythmic drugs.\n6. Catheter ablation plays an important role in the man- agement of AF in HCM. Although no RCTs exist in this area, several meta-analyses have been published in patients with HCM undergoing catheter ablation for drug refractory AF, including one that compared catheter ablation between patients with HCM versus a cohort without HCM.12,25 In general, the procedure is safe and remains an important tool. However, the re- sults seem less favorable compared with patients without HCM, with a 2-fold higher risk of relapse, more frequent need of repeat procedures, and higher use of concomitant antiarrhythmic drugs. This is attributed to the fact that patients with HCM have a greater degree of electrophysiologic and structural remodeling than the population without HCM.25 Contributing factors for atrial remodeling include LVOTO, diastolic impair- ment, MR, and other factors. It can be postulated that aggressive intervention in the earlier stages of disease would be more effective, but this is unproven, and ongoing remodeling is expected. Some authors have suggested the need for a more extensive ablation approach, with linear lesions and ablation of triggers not associated with the pulmonary veins often required to improve the long-term durability of the procedure.26\n7. AF in patients with HCM is often poorly tolerated; therefore, aggressive rhythm-control strategies are sometimes required. Because of the lower success rate of catheter ablation in patients with HCM compared with the general AF population, surgical AF ablation is a potential rhythm management option, especially in patients already undergoing open heart surgery for a surgical myectomy. In combination with surgical relief of the LVOT gradient and MR, which can limit or even\nreverse negative atrial remodeling, concomitant sur- gical AF ablation may be successful in decreasing AF burden. Several studies have reported satisfactory midterm efficacy, yet these reports universally include a small number of patients, and the durability of the procedure appears to decrease with time.27,29 In a study that represents the largest series of patients with AF treated surgically, freedom from AF recurrence at 1 year was 44% for ablation patients (n = 49) and 75%\nwith the maze procedure (n = 72) (P<0.001).10 In this study, with concomitant surgical ablation, freedom from AF at 3 years was 70%, with left atrial size being a predictor of recurrence.10"

Therapy includes pre- vention of thromboembolic events and controlling symptoms. Traditional stroke risk scoring systems used in the general population are not predictive in patients with HCM. Vitamin K antagonists are effective for stroke pre- vention, and recent studies support the use of DOACs as well.1-5 Asymptomatic AF detected by cardiac devices or monitors also increases risk of stroke, so the decision to anticoagulate should take into consideration the duration of episodes as well as underlying risk factors. When a rhythm-control strategy is needed, several antiar- rhythmic drugs have been shown to be safe and effective, allowing for individualization according to underlying substrate and patient preference. Catheter ablation is also an option, although the procedure is less effective than in the general population, and there is a more frequent need of repeat procedures and concomitant use of antiar- rhythmic drugs. Surgical AF ablation is a potential rhythm management option in patients undergoing surgical myectomy. Other supraventricular arrhythmias and atrial flutter are likely not increased in incidence in patients with HCM, and treatment is usually similar to populations without HCM."

Ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF (365).\nThe risk of stroke associated with AF is well established, and several RCTs have demonstrated the efficacy of anticoagulation for stroke prevention in patients with additional risk factors (366). Anticoagulation has also been shown to prevent stroke when administered during the weeks immediately before and after cardioversion (367). Whether atrial flutter carries a risk of stroke similar to that in patients with AF has been debated in the past but is now supported by limited evidence from mechanistic, observational, and prospective studies that include patients primarily with atrial flutter (365-369). Several reports have suggested that the risk of stroke in patients with atrial flutter is mitigated by anticoagulation. Meta-analysis of 13 studies of patients undergoing cardioversion of atrial flutter reported short-term stroke risks ranging from 0% to 7%, and the thromboembolism rate in patients with sustained flutter in 4 studies averaged 3% annually (365). Other studies have reported similar risk and effectiveness of anticoagulation (369). Therefore, on the basis of available data, recommendations for antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial flutter are similar to those for patients with AF (10).\n| IIa B-R See Online Data Supplements 16 and 17. | 1. The following drugs can be useful to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with symptomatic, recurrent atrial flutter, with the drug choice depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities: a. Amiodarone (376) b. Dofetilide (346,377) c. Sotalol (378) |\n| In patients in whom ablation is not being considered because of contraindications (such as underlying medical illness) or because of patient preference, a variety of antiarrhythmic drugs are available. These drugs act by suppressing triggers and altering atrial tissue refractoriness. Individual properties of each drug need to be considered for proper use. Much of the data pertaining to use of amiodarone in management of atrial arrhythmias has been derived from use in patients with AF(10). Few data are available for patients with atrial flutter. Amiodarone has significant toxicities, so it is used only when other treatments are contraindicated or ineffective. Nevertheless, administration is reasonable, particularly in patients with heart failure or significant underlying heart disease (376). Dofetilide may be more effective than many other drugs but must be started in an inpatient setting (346,377). The dose is adjusted on the basis of renal function, with close monitoring of the Q-T interval and subsequent monitoring for altered renal function. Sotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic, is generally well tolerated but is associated with typical beta blocker side effects, such as fatigue and bradycardia (378). The major potential cardiac toxicity for both drugs is torsades de pointes. |\n| IIa | B-NR | 2. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF (317,379-381). |\n| See Online Data Supplements 16 and 17. | Some patients with AF treated with propafenone, flecainide, or amiodarone will develop atrial flutter. In this circumstance, if flutter becomes the dominant arrhythmia, ablation of the CTI and continued use of the antiarrhythmic drug can decrease the incidence of atrial flutter and facilitate the pharmacological management of AF (379,380). |\n| IIa | C-LD | 3. Catheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter (381,382). |\n| See Online Data Supplements 16 and 17. | The indications for catheter ablation of AF are discussed in the 2014 AF guideline (10). When AF and atrial flutter coexist, 1 randomized study demonstrated that at 1-year follow-up, greater success in terms of arrhythmia suppression and quality-of-life score resulted from AF ablation (with or without atrial flutter ablation) than from atrial flutter ablation alone (381). It may be that AF ablation alone is sufficient to control both arrhythmias, although CTI ablation reduced the early postablation arrhythmia recurrence rate (382). |\n| IIa C-LD | 4. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non-CTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options (135). |\n| See Online Data Supplement 17. | No prospective RCTs have compared the efficacy or safety of antiarrhythmic drugs with that of catheter ablation for non-CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Observational data, however, support the relative effectiveness and safety of catheter ablation in experienced centers (135,327). Many of the atrial flutters that are observed during the first 3 months after ablation or cardiac surgery will not persist beyond the periprocedural period, so attempts at ablation can be deferred unless attempts at pharmacological therapy or cardioversion are unsuccessful (135). |\n| IIb B-R | 1. Flecainide or propafenone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic recurrent atrial flutter (383-385). |\n| See Online Data Supplements 16 and 17. | Data to support the recommendation for flecainide and propafenone for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter is derived from trials that pooled patients with AF and atrial flutter, with the vast majority of the patients having AF. It is therefore possible that these agents are not as effective for treating isolated atrial flutter as they are for AF (386). Flecainide and propafenone may result in slowing of the atrial flutter cycle length, which may lead to a rapid 1:1 ventricular response (387). Because of this, caution is advised with flecainide and propafenone in patients with atrial flutter at risk of 1:1 conduction. The risk may be reduced by coadministration of medications that slow AV nodal conduction, such as beta blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem. |\n\nIIb C-LD"

            "text/markdown": "TOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES\n1. Shared decision-making is essential to provide the best clinical care. This involves thoughtful dialogue among patients, families, and their care team in which health care professionals present all available testing and treatment options; discuss the risks, benefits, and applicability of those options to the individual pa- tient; and ensure the patient expresses their personal preferences and goals to develop their treatment plan.\n2. Although the primary cardiology team can initiate evaluation, treatment, and longitudinal care, referral to multidisciplinary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) centers with appropriate expertise can be important to optimizing care for patients with HCM. Challenging treatment decisions-where reasonable alternatives exist, where the strength of recommendation is weak (eg, any decision relying on a Class of Recommendation 2b) or is particularly nuanced (eg, interpretation of genetic testing; primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator decision-making), and for HCM-specific invasive procedures-may critically benefit from involving specialized HCM centers.\n3. Careful ascertainment of family history, counseling patients with HCM about the potential for genetic transmission of HCM, and options for genetic testing are cornerstones of care. Screening first-degree family members of patients with HCM, using either genetic testing, serial imaging, or electrocardiogramaur- veillance as appropriate, can begin at any age and can be influenced by specifics of the patient and family history and family preference. Because screening recommendations for family members hinge on the pathogenicity of any detected variants, the reported pathogenicity should be reconfirmed every 2 to 3 years, and input from specialized HCM centers with genetics expertise may be valuable.\n4. Assessing a patient's risk for sudden cardiac death is an important component of management. Integrating the presence or absence of established risk markers with tools to estimate individual risk score will facilitate the patient's ability to participate in decision-making regarding implantable cardioverter- defibrillator placement. These discussions should incorporate a patient's personal level of risk tolerance and their specific treatment goals.\n5. The risk factors for sudden cardiac death in children with HCM carry different weights and components than those used in adult patients. Pediatric risk stratification also varies with age and must account for different body sizes. Coupled with the complexity of placing implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in young patients with anticipated growth and a higher risk of device complications, the threshold for\nimplantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation in children often differs from adults. These differences are best addressed at comprehensive HCM centers with expertise in caring for children with HCM. New risk calculators, specific to children and adolescents, have been validated and can help young patients and their families contextualize their estimated risk of sudden cardiac death.\n6. Cardiac myosin inhibitors are now available to treat patients with symptomatic obstructive HCM. This new class of medication inhibits actin-myosin interaction, thus decreasing cardiac contractility and reducing left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Mava- camten is currently the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent. These agents can be beneficial for patients with obstructive HCM who do not derive adequate symptomatic relief from first-line drug therapy.\n7. Invasive septal reduction therapies (surgical septal myectomy and alcohol septal ablation), when per- formed by experienced HCM teams at dedicated cen- ters, can provide safe and effective symptomatic relief for patients with drug-refractory or severe outflow tract obstruction. Given the data on the significantly improved outcomes at comprehensive HCM centers, these decisions represent an optimal opportunity for referral.\n8. Patients with HCM and persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation have a sufficiently increased risk of stroke such that oral anticoagulation with direct-acting oral anticoagulants (or alternatively warfarin) should be considered the default treatment option irrespective of the CHA2DS2-VASc score. New tools to stratify risk for incident atrial fibrillation have been developed and may assist in determining the frequency of screening patients with ambulatory telemetry. Because rapid atrial fibrillation is often poorly toler- ated in patients with HCM, maintenance of sinus rhythm and rate control are key treatment goals.\n9. Exercise stress testing is particularly helpful in determining overall exercise tolerance and for latent exercise provoked left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Because children may not describe symptoms readily, routine exercise testing can be particularly important for young patients.\n10. Increasingly, data affirm that the beneficial effects of exercise on general health are extended to patients with HCM. Healthy recreational exercise (light [<3 metabolic equivalents], moderate [3-6 metabolic equivalents], and vigorous [>6 metabolic equivalents] intensity levels) has not been associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia events in short-term studies. If patients pursue rigorous exer- cise training for the purpose of performance or\ncompetition, it is important to engage in a compre- hensive discussion and seek input from expert HCM professionals regarding the potential risks and bene- fits, to develop an individualized training plan, and to establish a regular schedule for reevaluation."
