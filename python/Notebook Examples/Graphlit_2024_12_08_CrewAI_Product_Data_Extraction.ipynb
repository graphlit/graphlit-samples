Together with the electric motor, the 8-speed Tiptronic S automatic transmission and the specially tuned chassis systems, the engine enables the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid to achieve excellent straight line and cornering performance. Dynamic handling and comfortable travel co-exist perfectly in the Cayenne Turbo E-Hybrid, with the help of the enhanced chassis and technologies that adapt the vehicle even better to the preferred use. Examples of the technologies include the adaptive air suspension with level system and height adjustment, and the Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus) for variable power transmission to the rear wheels for optimized traction and steering precision.\u001b[00m\n",
